I liked the taste and although it's a little complicated to prepare, overall I felt it was flavorful and filling. I feel that the packaging is a bit deceptive though. You are supposed to soak the noodles for a moment then drain, then add two different packets - one with a concentrated flavor sauce and the other with dried veggies and other flavorings. Add more water, cover and cook in microwave for about 1 min. On the surface this is a one serving, biodegradable bowl... BUT the packaging says there are 2 servings per bowl... so the 730 grams of sodium is really 1460 for one meal. tsk, tsk tsk. I think they should have either made the bowl or the serving smaller OR made the label read it as one serving with the true amount of sodium you'll get when you eat this for a meal. I tried separating it in to halves... it's not that easy, and besides.... where would you store the other half?  I guess you could just make the whole thing and throw away the other half, but seems like a waste.

Costco sells the worst tasting canned pink salmon, these are much better. Pink salmon is sold in cans. These are all small salmons so you will get couple of whole salmon in a can with all the bones and the skin. Amazon's product feature description is wrong. You can not take out the skin and the bone that easily so you may forget about buying this salmon. There is no vitamin A in this salmon either. I consume a lot of wild fish, sprats, sardines, herrings... no farm raised or fresh fish unless I catch it myself since fresh fish means few weeks old except shell fish which I get it in three days. The smaller the fish the more nutrition in the fish. I consume these salmon since these salmon stay in the rivers of cold Pacific for first few years in order not to be consumed by the bigger fish and feast on small bugs and fish which are high in nutrients. Bones means calcium. Skin means good polyunsaturated fat. I mix all my fish with many different vegetables since that is my main ingredient for protein.  This salmon is in water not vegetable oil. I drain the water since that is where the 2000 mg of salt is lingering around and no need to consume salt. Healthy, without any additives, growth hormones, pesticides, antibiotics, carpet dye, or sitting on a shelf exposed to air for few weeks... Sockeye salmon is the only fresh wild salmon you can get during the spring run and sold as smoked salmon which I consume but cost more. Atlantic and steelhead are only farm raised. Keta, Pink, Chum, Coho are always canned. Bravo.<br /><br />99% of all cans are lined in plastic which leach high levels of a chemical called Bisphenol A, which has been linked to cancer, clogging of arteries, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information. This product claims that it has no BPA.

I am often disappointed in getting back to an unfinished portion and finding them stale. After being stuck with practically bendable crackers later, I started emptying the whole container into a ziplock back and hoping they remained crisp.<br /><br />Well, now they've introduced a new ""Fresh Stacks"" packaging, which cuts the number of crackers in each individual package in half. Just about the right amount of crackers for two to enjoy.<br /><br />The rest is easy, just get a glass of your favorite beverage and enjoy these iconic crackers, knowing that the next ""stack"" is going to be crisp and fresh! My serving suggestion is to layer vanilla ice cream between two of these bad boys and you have about the best ice cream sandwich possible.<br /><br />But exactly does the world ""graham"" mean? In 1829, a minister named Sylvester Graham invented a new way to process flour. Instead of grinding whole grain wheat kernels , graham flour's parts get ground up separately. The inside of the kernel gets ground at a fine setting, which makes standard white flour. Then the outside germ and bran are ground using a coarse setting. Once they are all mixed together, it creates a more textured product which bakes easier and tastes sweeter. It's also much better for you and has a higher fiber content.<br /><br />Well, as alternately boring and interesting as that all is, we owe it to Sylvester for today's resulting graham crackers, which are pretty much a staple food at my house. And Nabisco's Honey Maid is - after much testing of other manufacturers' competing product - easily the best graham cracker out there. And this new packaging idea has made them even better!"

At all. And especially in these cruel and seemingly-endless winters. It's a fabulous idea and saves running to the bodega in the scary 'hood at midnight when I realize that my princely master (I have learned that the adage -- 'people have dogs and cats have people' is all-too-true, though I am struggling to remain in charge) is out of food. I also seem to really love parenthetical asides, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Anywho,(here's *that* thing) when I received my first shipment and realized that this was far more than my cat (this is my first cat, a stray whom I had no choice but to take in -- so I am new at cat-ism, previously being a dog person) would eat in a month, I immediately logged in to change the frequency and/or amount of the auto-ship order and it seems my only option is to cancel. This is pesky and bothersome because that leaves me with two choices, as I see it; cancel the auto-ship, or, let the cat food pile up till I have enough cat food to last a year and then cancel. So I give the product 5 stars because my finicky little Prince Wonderfluff loves it and it is healthy and free of the chemicals which are all-too-present in food in this country, but I think Amazon needs to fix the auto-ship options so that when you click on the impending subsequent shipment, you can make such changes to frequency and amount. There may be an existing way to do this but I can't figure it out and I make web sites for a living so I can generally figure out how to do such things.<br /><br />I suppose a third option is to contact Amazon Customer Service but that's not a quick and easy task and I am busy trying to maintain order and earn a living."

Hong,3,3,2,1286755200,Reviewers are right,"Definitely a few things I agree that other reviewers noted:<br /><br />1) Small loaf - only really makes a 1 lb-er even if it gives instructions on a 1.5 loaf<br />2) Rise problems - my boxes don't expire until 2012 but I still had rise problems. A friend from the culinary school nearby said it might be because there is a lot more whole wheat in it (a good thing for the body, not as good in the bread maker). As noted in another review, baking it in the oven really did make a better and higher loaf.<br />3) Butter is best - tried oil and butter and butter is definitely better.<br />4) A little more salt - I added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt and that seemed to help with the rise as well.<br /><br />It's a great backup for when you're out of bread flour or yeast but I still think the best bread machine recipe from allrecipes.com (subbing in 2 cups of flour, 1 cup whole wheat) makes for the most delicious and closest to store bought I've seen thus far."

Its consistency and taste proves that it has not been processed or diluted with sugar and water. If you compare it with processed honey that is sold in stores you would actually feel there is a raw taste to this brand. Processed honey has syrup-like taste and it stays liquid for a long time. If you are looking for raw honey, you have to know that it changes its color and consistency over time.<br />I have also noticed that no matter how much you can eat it, this honey does not make your stomach upset unlike processed store brands.<br /><br />In order for honey to be beneficial it has to be raw! There is no way it can deliver all its goodness to you if it's been processed! Honey is a wonder food! It has been scientifically proven to help heal wounds as it has antibacterial properties; to help restore healthy intestinal flora as it is a prebiotic; help recover from illnesses faster; help you sleep better; restore your nervous system after stressful events (try a cup of herbal tea with raw honey after a stressful day!) and even make your skin contain moisture. Raw unprocessed honey does not make your sugar spike if you are diabetic. But it absolutely has to be raw! If you buy processed honey you just waste your money, you can as well just buy some high fructose corn syrup....<br />Thank you for selling your honey raw! I wish one day people will be educated enough to avoid processed foods."

The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.

Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow."

I doubt that anyone other than perhaps someone with extreme willpower and self-control (but why!!??) would limit themselves to a 1/4 cup of this wonderful (AND it's organic and NON GMO!) granola.<br /><br />I ate a few handfuls (then a few/many more) -- I put it in a WHOLE (9 ounce) cup and added hot coffee (yumyumyum!) then tried it in a cup of hot water. Then I poured this granola into another cup into which I added cold water -- you get the idea-- I have been eating many servings of Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola (Dark Chocolate and Berries) nonstop all day at my desk in my humble cubicle and it has been a INTENSE and wonderful experience. The only thing(s) I did NOT do were to add cream and then at the next sitting, to add soy (only because they were unavailable - my office mates use that powdery fake ""stuff"") -- but I have NO DOUBT that either addition would have been embraced by the subtle, chocolate-ness and taste-bud-embracing crunchiness of this delightful concoction. Try it atop ice cream with WHIPPED CREAM! Try it in your Yogurt!!!<br /><br />Could I taste the berries? No, not really  -- peering into the bag gave me a good look at them -- they are there -- but I have no doubt that they too contributed to the excellence of this Granola Nirvana.<br /><br />Could I taste the delightful chocolate squares that are interspersed among the chocolate-y graola chunks in this bag? Yes, when eating out of hand they were smooth and melted in my mouth for intense chocolate flavor -- it was almost a sacrilege to pour hot water on them in the cup, but (sigh) for the sake of this review process, I did.<br /><br />I could see the little flax seeds swimming around in there -- and as for the coconut, I could barely taste it, and since I have this small problem with coconut (not really a fan of it), I was very happy to realize that it DID not impact my enjoyment of this granola -- so THAT is GOOD<br /><br />As in any granola, there are alot of calories from fat (55 calories -- about 39% of the total calories are fat). NO Cholesterol, low sodium, some fiber (of course, the coconut and the flax seeds and the oats, maybe even the fruits).<br /><br />Since this Granola was created for a wedding, then the calories should not really be a problem -- for what is a wedding but a joyful occasion where many calories are burned off? So I would suggest that this Granola not only be enjoyed as a breakfast cereal for those who are embarking on the usual stressful commute (think ""run for bus"" ""run for train"" etc etc) but also for lunchbox treats, and definitely camping and hiking. It WILL give your day a Lift.<br /><br />So what's NOT to LOVE about this? Those who have allergies should read the label -- ""contains soy"", and ""produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts and tree nuts"".<br /><br />PS-- So why did I not add milk to this LOVElLY Granola? Because I am lactose Intolerant. ""Then why add Cream, Ace?"" you might say. Well, because cream has alot of little fat globs in it and that makes it digest slower -- ergo I rarely have trouble digesting cream (or whipped cream either, to my delight)."

So far, I have not been sick while all of my staff have been out from 1 to 6 days with the flu.  For me, this tea took some getting use too but I now enjoy it daily and look forward to my one or two cups a day.<br /><br />This tea has a strong peppermint or euclypatic taste to it.  A taste that I was not use to but after the first few sips, the peppermint taste was not as strong and I really think this tea helps reduce congestion.  Only thing I add to this tea is 1 teaspoon of honey.  I have shared it with both sisters and my mom and they really like it.<br /><br />Give it a try, the health benefits are worth it and after that first sinus opening sip, the taste grows on you!"

As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe."

Is it Too Good to be True?,"Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea beverage is a decent- flavored beverage loaded with nutrition, with minimal calories, low sodium, and none of the bad qualities that make so many other beverages so unappealing. Oh, and one other thing: The manufacturer claims that consuming this beverage will help you burn extra calories. This product is decent in flavor, with the light taste of green tea backed with a small amount of raspberry and some medicinal properties. It is non- cabonated, smooth, and as easy to consume as a glass of water.<br /><br />The key difference between this and your average green tea beverage is the calorie- burning claim. The manufacturer claims that this beverage helps you burn about one- hundred calories per can and when you consider that there are only about ten calories in each serving, it would therefore mean that consuming this beverage will actually result in negative calories. This almost sounds too good to be true, but a quick examination of the ingredients makes it easier to understand why this is possible. This product contains added stimulants in the form of caffeine and taurine. These stimulants will give your metabolism a boost, and this extra metabolism will likely lead to added caloric loss. The manufacturer is cautious when it makes this claim, pointing out that results are best when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. I can see how this drink could contribute to some extra caloric expenditure, due to the added boost of energy, but like the manufacturer claims, it takes more than ingesting stimulants to lose weight. You still need to control your eating habits and exercise for maximum effect.<br /><br />The added stimulants could discourage some people from trying this beverage, but another potential turn- off is the price. Purchasing a couple of cases of this product would be almost as expensive as buying an inexpensive piece of exercise equipment. Unless I was seriously into losing weight and wanted any little bit of help I could get, I am not so sure this product would be worth the money.<br /><br />Still, when all things are considered, Celsius Raspberry Acai Green Tea is a good beverage that is worth trying. The nutrition is much better than that found in most beverages and the taste, while it does have an artificial sweetener finish, is pleasant nonetheless. I'm a little cautious about consuming anything that contains multiple stimulants and increases my heart rate, but this is still a good product; better than the vast majority of beverages on the market and certainly worth trying if you're looking for a liquid fitness companion."

Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious brat every time I go near the bucket.<br /><br />I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied ""Yo momma is fat!"") and that we should start watching her calories.<br /><br />If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!"

Finding one that our dog, Kuma-chan liked eating was a challenge.  We've tried tablets in her food and she would smell it mixed in and not eat until the next day.  Other biscuit type supplements were left uneaten.  Sometimes the gel capsule would be left at the bottom of her dinner bowl.<br /><br />As soon as the Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint Peanut Butter Large Dog Biscuits arrived, I offered a biscuit to Kuma.  She took it, wagged her tail and came back for another one!  Now, she knows that she only gets one every morning before her chicken jerky treats!

I used the clay litter with those sifting liners and all was well.<br /><br />Well, as my little guy is now over 10 years old, he's gotten funny in his ways.  He seems to like to get in his box and toss litter all over the place before . . . uh . . . handling his business.  That was making my bathroom a mess.  I'd have to sweep and mop before putting down my bath mat to take a bath and it was just too much so this week I switched back to crystals.  Yippee!<br /><br />The low tracking is what does it for me.  For the few crystals that get out of the box, it's no issue to clean up quickly.  No fine dust to contend with.  The solid litter is a breeze to remove and I stir about twice a day, usually when I'm already in the bathroom and notice he's gone.  I mean, you can't even tell I have a cat in the house.  Zero odor, little tracking and easy to clean.  The only thing I do is use a liner with it so that whatever liquid does get through doesn't seep into the plastic over time and stink it up.  The simple fact that this litter is lighter overall is just wonderful.  Less mess and less dust make it a winner.<br /><br />I would LOVE if I could buy this product in a 40-lb box so I could keep it on hand instead of buying small bags.

And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.

Hes able to eventually chew it up, but it does take him much longer (which is a plus for most dog owners!) For the smaller one, I try to pick out the smaller poppers.

I learned that it not only about taking a pill, you got to make sure you eat extra food and drink extra liquids. Also timely pumping or breastfeeding is very important too. I noticed, as soon I'd start extracting or taking pills at different times, milk amounts would start messing up. So I started pumping 4 times a day, every 6 hours, day or night, and it became stable and enough for a baby. It is truth that pills give a gas, not only baby, but I was gassy too, but I started taking smaller dose than written on package, 4 pills a day- every time I'd pump. Supply was still good, but a baby wasn't as gassy. Later on as she got bigger, it was unnoticeable, rather I'd say it was due to a food (pickles, cabbage, etc). Most importantly, I believe breast feeding was more valuable over gas issue. I've met so many women who were just too lazy to give their babies what is best for them."

This roast easily compares to the beans roasted locally that go for 4x more. Keep in mind I'm running this through an espresso machine with a Breville Smart grinder and also using it for a drip machine at work. If you're looking for a dark roast, you may want to try their Peruvian as it seems people have taken to liking that for their press and drips.<br /><br />For $22 (for an order of 1) it's an amazing value, the fact that it's organic is an added bonus! Although with super saver shipping it takes maybe a week to get in... IF you go with subscribe you'll not only get it for under $20, it'll be shipped to you in express(you should try it first with a single order of course, but I'm sure you'll find this roast extremely satisfying even for the coffee snobs). They use Ontrac for the west coast, which is an overnight service. Not sure how they ship out to the central, midwest, and east coast but I'm sure you'll get it in a matter of days.<br /><br />Take it for someone who hasn't used the same roast twice for the past 3 months, try this first and go from there. I will tell you, this is one of the best tasting roast I've had and a steal for the price."

If you don't have something under you, you will spill tons of crumbs all over.  It is rather ridiculous & frustrating.<br /><br />The flavor is very good! Out of the 3 cookie flavors I've tried, I like these the best. As for their other cookies, I have tried their fig cookies & their chocolate cream filled. The chocolate cream suffers the same overly messy crumbs as these cookies do & has an odd flavor.  The fig have very little taste & the cookie is soft.  So soft, that it falls apart in your hand before you can even take a bite!<br /><br />While the ingredients are mostly good there is room for improvement: organic soy flour, NON organic soy lecithin (GMO anyone?), inulin & natural vanilla flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients as per the box are as follows:  organic cane sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic rice flour, organic sunflower oil, organic tapioca starch, organic potato starch, organic eggs, organic soy flour, organic rice starch, organic rice syrup, organic nonfat dry milk, organic cocoa, organic arabic gum, organic egg yolks, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), salt, inulin, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor, guar gum.<br /><br />Since there are so few organic gluten free options that taste good these are a better choice than many.  I like Pamela's for example, but they only contain some organic ingredients - hopefully Pamela's changes that.<br /><br />At this point, I have satisfied my curiosity in the Jovial line & am not likely to purchase any more of their products.

The whole shebang comes in a cardboard box that opens like a laptop and can presumably be closed again (I ate everything and so didn't close it).  There's even a sudoku puzzle on the inside(of mine at least). Also inside are individually wrapped containers of Late July brand rich crackers, Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame with salt, Gopicnic's Chili Lime Salmon spread, Gopicnic's Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix, and a Terra Nostra's organic robust dark chocolate square.  These items are all shelf stable for several months as long as kept in a cool dry place (meaning that you probably shouldn't store these in your car in the summertime for more than a few hours).<br /><br />I have a love hate relationship with salmon.  Either I love it (usually in the form of spreads and cakes) or I hate it (grilled, broiled, pan fried filets) so I expected to love this version.  Surprisingly, I'm kind of on the fence about this very orange appearing spread.  It has a nice salmon flavor (and large flakes of fish in the mix) that is just slightly fishy and you can taste the lime, but to me the chili was really lacking.  I think with more of a chili note in the spread I would have enjoyed it much more. 3 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Salmon Spread Ingredients:Alaskan pink salmon, water, red pepper paste, sugar, lime juice, modified cornstarch, salt, vinegar, garlic powder, chili powder, spices (no MSG), natural lime flavor, maltodextrin, and natural color.  The salmon comes from a MSC certified fishery.<br /><br />The Late July Crackers (which I have had before) are always delicious and remind me much of a flaky butter type cracker.  The salmon spread went well on them and they weren't brittle enough to break when the spread was applied.  The utensil given for this purpose was a fork. 6 Crackers come in a pack and I found that I had a little more salmon than cracker (although I didn't go crazy with the application. 5 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Cracker Ingredients: Organic Wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice, organic oleic safflower oil and/or organic oleic sunflower oil, organic palm oil, sea salt, leavening, soy lecithin, enzymes.<br /><br />I didn't really like the Dry Roasted Edamame.  The only taste at all that I got from them was the bare hint of salt added.  I think with all the other flavor packed items in this picnic a seasoned variety could have better competed with everything.  Otherwise it was somewhat bland and I had no desire to finish the small packet. 1 Star for this product<br /><br />Edamame Ingredients:Soybeans, Sea Salt<br /><br />I think my favorite item in this packet would be the Ginger Zip fruit mix.  It was tasty, but not too sweet, with just the lightest touch of ginger that I thought was perfect and didn't overpower the natural flavors of the dried fruit and peanut mixture.  Sadly, it was only a .75 oz packet and I ran out before I wanted to.  I would gladly have traded the edamame for a bigger packet of this snack. 5 Stars for this product<br /><br />Mix Ingredients:Ginger peanuts, (sugar, ground ginger, sea salt), cranberries, banana chips.<br /><br />Last but not least is the dark chocolate square.  I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and since this was 60% cacao it suited me just fine.  It had just a hint of sweetness with that wonderful bitterness you can only get from darker chocolates. 4 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Chocolate Ingredients:Organic dark chocolate, dry cocoa solids.<br /><br />Allergies: On all items the packaging warns for Soy, Milk, Wheat, Peanuts, Fish, and Treenuts.<br /><br />Overall I'd have to say that this was a pretty good snack that I could see myself taking to work or on a car trip with me. I'd prefer that a couple of the ingredients would change but it still filled me up despite my avoidance of some items, but didn't over fill me to the point where I felt sleepy after lunch.<br /><br />Review by M.

Just three months after starting on Wellness Healthy Weight, she has shed several pounds and is well on her way to being at her ideal weight again. Our other, healthy-weight dog has also been eating this food without any noticeable weight gain or loss and without having any food allergy flare-ups. The best part is that both dogs love the food, and they are both picky, picky eaters. If you're looking for a high-quality, no-filler holistic food to help your lazy, treat-filled pooch lose some of those extra pounds, give this one a try."

All my dogs are on grain-free dry food. So naturally I started him on dry food. Later on, I tried different wet food but he refused them.<br /><br />My cat is not an eager eater. He gets unlimited supply of dried food throughout the day, and he always finishes fixed amount which is in line with vet's recommendation. He also snacks on Pounce throughout the day, but mostly he prefers just to play. Play with his hyperactive adopted doggie siblings, his adopted human, or any newly discovered toys. He plays non-stop about 80% of his awake time. Food comes second in priority. That was all true, until he met the Friskies canned cat food months later.<br /><br />The first time my cat tried the Friskies savory shreds whitefish and tuna in sauce, he hestiated just like when he first encountered cheese, yogurt, or small chunks of steak. But unlike steaks or cheese which he simply left untouched nowadays, he took one lick of the Friskies shreded seafood and he gulbbed down whatever he could fit into his tiny tummy. Since then, he's fed a mix of dry and wet food. He still gets unlimited dried food through the day and only one meal of wet food at night (mixed with dry food). He's usually not very vocal and hardly talk. But when he sees his wet food coming in the special bowl, he would follow the bowl and sing all the way to his dinning area.<br /><br />Like all pet owners, I hope my cat would always eat a healthy and balanced diet. I also wish he would prefer some food that would smell more pleasing to human sense than his current favorite, this Friskies. But being such a good, well behaved, and healthy pet, I think he deserves something he likes so much. My cat has been on a mix of dry and wet food for a few months now. He's long and lean like a 10 pound tiger. And the vet is giving him a clean bill of health. One day he may grow tired of this, or gain enough weight for us to be alarmed. But as long as he stays healthy and fit and sings the Friskies' praises, this will remain his nighttime snack!"

We got this toy for him when he was only around 10 weeks old.  It was challenging for him the first time.  When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, ""Okay, now what?  What's next??""<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing. It is rare that he flips it over, too, so it's weighted well.<br /><br />Cons: Too easy, finished with it and bored within a minute, if not a few seconds."

I had read that xylitol is more or less a 'natural' product, and after having heard a professional chef give glowing reports of Ideal (xylitol) on a radio program, I ordered the three bulk forms of the product.<br />It tastes fine in beverages. Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute.<br />I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking.

I bought this based on the reviews and it was the stalest, most bitter whole bean coffee I've ever used.  One of the canisters was open on arrival but there was literally no difference between the aromas of the sealed cans and the open can.  What does that say about the freshness of the sealed cans?  You can seal it tight as a drum but if the coffee sat around and got stale before it was canned then all the vacuum in the world won't help it.  Then I couldn't get that stale aroma/flavor out of my grinder without thoroughly cleaning it.  I don't know what you guys are used to drinking but this isn't worth 1/4 of the price regardless of how much it costs.  If you think this is 5 stars then check out RONA, which Amazon carries.  Their Jamaican Blue Mountain Peaberry is without peer.  Compare their Kenya AA Superior Peaberry to this swill and you will know what premium coffee is supposed to taste like.

Rose,0,0,4,1278892800,Good coffee but takes trial-and-error re: amount to use.,"I brought this coffee up to my parents' cabin on a vacation and we all drank it for about a week. No one in my family is really a coffee connoisseur (including myself), so I can't really speak to the complications of the flavor or anything like that.<br /><br />We did all think it was good coffee, the hazelnut flavor was clearly present but not overpowering, and it wasn't too sweetsy as some flavored coffees can be.<br /><br />Downsides are the proportions of coffee / water seem to be a little different than the plain ol' coffee my parents normally use. I couldn't tell if it was too strong or too weak, but something tasted a little different to me (I mean besides the hazelnut flavor). I think this coffee might require slightly more to be added to the maker before brewing to bring out the hazelnut flavor as opposed to the amount you'd add for normal coffee.<br /><br />This coffee tastes good w/ cream and sugar, if you're into it, or black, as I prefer. One thing I'd caution against is mixing it with those flavored 'Coffee Mate' creamers. My mom and sister were doing that and had some pretty nasty cups (Pumpkin Spice and Caramel were nasty to me). Best off drinking this stuff black or with normal cream/sugar. Probably obvious to everyone else, but some people in my family are addicted to Coffee Mate.<br /><br />Anyway, that's it. I'm no coffee snob but do think this is good coffee, with a nice hazelnut flavor.

I just could never find a full taste in any of them.  So, I gave up on k-cups and went back to my trusty home drip brewer.<br /><br />Then one day our company bought kuerig machines for the office.  So, I decided that I'd go out and try to find a decently priced k-cup, as anything tastes better than the sludge that they make in their industrial drip machines.

And I opened a third container, and it was just as disappointing as the first two had been.  (I usually keep several containers on hand because I would not ever want to run out of Ovaltine.)<br /><br />I am done with Ovaltine.  I did find a web page posted by the product manufacturer, and they were saying they had switched over to all natural ingredients for flavoring, and they have learned that there are variations in potency when you use natural products.  So essentially, they were saying ""sorry for the screw up.""  (This reminds me of New Coke.)<br /><br />I am never buying another Ovaltine again.

I have bought many different toys for my dog and he destroys them all within a few days.  This bone is great because it has actually lasted over two weeks and is still going strong.  The ends are getting chewed up but at a very slow pace.  My guess is this will easily last a month or two, if not longer.  My dog also absolutely loves chewing on this.  If he is inside sitting around this bone is in his mouth being chewed.  That is why I am so surprised it has lasted this long.

These, however, are delicious. They do remind me of Ritz crackers (at least what I remember from eating them 2 years ago) except not quite as oily.<br /><br />Good:<br />- They taste good and have a really nice texture.<br />- I don't think they are exceptionally bland - they have a slight buttery flavor and seem like generic crackers to me. Definitely more flavor that water crackers<br />- I don't taste the funny aftertaste that one of the reviewers mentions. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to that taste than I am.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Cost<br />- Broken crackers: I agree with other reviewers that the packages often contain a lot of broken ones. This is not just when they are purchased online; it is also true of boxes that I've purchased at a store like Whole Foods. I guess these crackers are just fragile and need special packaging.<br /><br />That combination of downsides makes it a tough choice for me about whether to buy these crackers. Do I really want to pay a lot (3-4x as much as ""glutinized"" crackers) for a box of broken crackers? I haven't decided. For now, they are a splurge that I indulge in occasionally."

In fact, my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room-temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3-4 refills, by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally bring the bitterness out, so that's when I toss it.<br /><br />The ""green"" flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash, though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious, tastes like real pear, and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it - strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea, and you like pears, give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.<br /><br />The package comes with a ""resealable freshness bag,"" though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea, which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag, and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas, but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests, that will remain a suspicion.<br /><br />There's no string on the teabags, and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which, as I mentioned, I am very fond of), but it's worth a mention.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

Too bad it doesn't agree with me.,"I ordered the 3-pound bag of Nutiva 50% Protein Hemp Powder at the beginning of July.  I wanted to replace whey protein with hemp protein to cut down on processed foods for bodybuilding.  The quality of the product was superb and fresh.  Taste-wise, it isn't the best tasting powder in the world, but that can easily be fixed by mixing it with almond milk.<br /><br />After drinking my first shake I noticed a lot of gas and bloating -- which is odd given that this product is supposed to have less bloat than whey.  I figured my body was simply adjusting to the extra fiber and kept taking it for the next month.<br /><br />For the second-third weeks, my body was able to tolerate this stuff relatively well.  However, when I reached the 6-7th week, I started getting severe bloating and stomach pains to the point of vomiting.  In addition, I got a slight headache, slight chills and muscle twitching in my ears.  Given this product's reputation, I didn't want to attribute my problems with this product.  I went to the doctor and he gave me a trial of a proton pump inhibitor.  I suspected my GI problems were due to the pre-workout supplement I was taking.  The proton pump inhibitor should allow my digestive system to heal.<br /><br />To rule this product out, I quit taking the hemp and pre-workout supplement for a few days and simply ate more regular food.  I felt better by the weekend.  After those few days, I tried whey protein.  No bloating.  That night, I tried another hemp shake (with almond milk).  One hour after drinking the shake, I got the severe bloating and pain again.. just as bad as before.  I also got the slight headache, chills and ear muscle twitching.  It definitely isn't the almond milk, as I drink almond milk all the time for breakfast.  It also isn't the fiber, as I eat salads full of broccoli all the time.<br /><br />It appears I have an allergic reaction to hemp protein powder.  That is a shame, given all the health benefits of hemp.<br /><br />For now, I will have to stick to whey."

They're organic.

They encourage independent eating - by this age, he slurps them up entirely on his own (once I twist off the cap, of course). They're a great way to get a little extra veggie content into his daily diet, especially on days when he's not in the mood for the vegetables on his plate at mealtimes. The ""super grain"" blended in makes this one a particularly healthy snack, with a little protein added to the fruit/veggie combination.<br /><br />The butternut squash/apple flavor was an instant hit, sweet and yummy.

It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't break down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.

Now that they are the same size, we can't keep them from stealing each other's food, so we needed something they could both eat.  We tried a couple of holistic all-stages foods, and this one has been the best, by far.  Both cats prefer the little ""T"" shape kibble over round kibble, they seem to enjoy the taste, and it keeps them and their digestive systems happy ... and that keeps ME happy.  ;-)  My older cat does better on a grain-free food, and has gotten a case of the itchies on this food, but it is not nearly as bad as with most grain-inclusive foods we've tried.  Once kitten is old enough, they will both be back on a grain-free diet.  In the meantime, this has really fit our needs."

Its mass might lead the consumer to believe that it somehow tastes different than the usual nutrient-free, chemically-laden glop that comprises Diet Coke, which seems to have become the International Women's Beverage. (As a person with a Y chromosome, I do not have the gender qualifications to drink this beverage, but I tried one anyway, along with some yogurt, the International Women's Food, as suggested by The Lifetime Channel and their wonderful films.) After careful evaluation, I determined that the eleven-pound mass of this can was not achieved by the addition of fruit juices or any actual nutritional food-like ingredients to the chemical glop. I now realized that some of the carbonated ""bubbles"" are actually black holes, a de-formation of space-time caused by collapsing stars, formerly difficult to obtain for the consumer but now conveniently available in these handy eleven-pound cans of diet coke. (I tried to give this product a five-star review, but somehow the five stars collapsed into two stars that each weigh 5.5 pounds.) Buy it! Drink it! The Black Hole Diet will not make you lose mass (quite the opposite), but it is entertaining and educational, and you can participate in the International Women's Cuisine Mandate while watching films about deceptive men on The Lifetime Channel."

I've also read the company is non-GMO but I haven't confirmed that information through e-mail. The point is that unless your pet is allergic to corn or rice you're wasting your time going grain free. Potatoes and peas are just as useless as corn or rice and cats would never eat any of these in the wild.

The process of converting regular cocoa to dutch cocoa involves soaking the nibs in an alkaline solution to reduce the acidity.

Some cookbooks warn that the difference in pH of regular and dutch processed cocoa can cause problems with leavening when baking but I have never had this problem with anything I have baked or made.  Cooks Illustrated magazine even rated this particular variety as one of the best cocoas you can buy.  Chocoholics like me who take their chocolate seriously will not be disappointed.

They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet."

It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime.

It's not at all unpleasant, the balance of sweet and salty is perfect. If you like butterscotch or Werther's hard candies, you'll almost certainly like these. It says they're made with real bits of bacon... true, but the bits are so tiny they don't make the texture so rough that it slices up your mouth or anything like some hard candies do, and they're not... hard. They don't create weird jagged edges or anything.<br /><br />Basically... as ""weird"" as this product is, it's surprisingly satisfying if you're a fan of more savory treats and that sweet/salty combo you get in caramels and butterscotches and even some types of yoghurt pretzels I've tried.

They didn't disappoint in the taste department, but.... I am a little disappointed about the ingredients in these.<br /><br />Ingredient #1: Organic Tapioca Syrup-this appears to be a great alternative to high fructose corn syrup and other sugary additives. Here's what I pulled up about this ingredient-"" Tapioca syrup provides the sweetness needed in a natural way. Produced from tapioca starch using a natural fermentation process, tapioca syrup is a gluten-free and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) alternative to corn syrup, sugar, honey, maple syrup and molasses.""  [...]<br /><br />Ingredient #2: Organic cane sugar-this is just sugar. It's organic, so it wasn't grown using pesticides or anything, but sugar is sugar and I try to limit it as much as possible. I'm bummed that this is the 2nd ingredient.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredients aren't really a big deal to me, but here they are: ORGANIC TAPIOCA SYRUP SOLIDS, ORGANIC WHITE GRAPE JUICE CONCENTRATE, PECTIN, CITRIC ACID, ASCORBIC ACID, COLOR (BLACK CARROT JUICE CONCENTRATE), NATURAL FLAVORS, SODIUM CITRATE, ORGANIC SUNFLOWER OIL, CARNAUBA WAX (FROM PALM LEAVES).<br /><br />So why am I let down by this product? There are tons of great tasting fruit snacks out there that don't use any extra sugar to sweeten them. Stretch Island Origional Fruit Leathers don't use any extra sugars, here's the ingredients of their summer strawberry fruit leather- ""Apple Puree Concentrate, Pear Puree Concentrate, Strawberry Puree, Organic Natural Strawberry Flavor, Lemon Juice Concentrate. All Sugars Are Found Naturally In The Fruit."" Clif sells their Twisted Fruit rope that has no added sugar. Archer Farms sells a fruit snack for a great price that has no added sugar.<br /><br />So the Annie's Organic Fruit snacks are a great tasting snack that is far above those icky artificial brands that are loaded with artificial dye's and sugar, but I still think there's some room for improvement by using only fruit to sweeten it, rather than cane sugar."

Grove Square sells for approximately half the price of other k cup brands in retail stores. That is because it is instant coffee designed to look like a k cup.  Makes the purchase price of this mix really steep since one third of my k cups were these cheapies!  I tried them once before and to me they are absolutely undrinkable.

I jumped at the chance to buy these Lavazza pods for 30¢ each. However, not all pods are created equal. I've always enjoyed Lavazza brand coffee, so I knew the taste would be good. But these pods are not packed as tightly as others - the grounds in Ily Caf&eacute; pods, for example, are packed much more tightly which allows more resistance to maintain the steam pressure required to make a great cup of espresso.<br /><br />With the Handpresso, and I found that if I overfill the water basket so that the pod is infused with a little water before I close up the nozzle - the grounds expand and offer a little more resistance when making the shot. Compared to they Ily pods, the Lavazza wasn't quite as good, but the espresso they deliver is still pretty tasty. Considering the price, this is still a very good deal. But if you're snooty about your coffee, you may prefer other brands of pods.<br /><br />Many vendors offer big sampler packs so you can try many different brands of ESE pods - if you've never used pods before - and you're particular about your java, I recommend trying a sampler pack before you commit to a large quantity like this."

She studied under the expatriate star, Tumbelova, and her husband, Serge Trouserin, but to no great effect. But Agatha could never resist the lure of the tu-tu, and that's why we have her here today. And here she comes!<br /><br />Moving quickly yet forcefully, belying her many years, she is flying around the stage, waving here hands hither and thither. Ah, but now she has stopped, striking poses in just one spot. Now a slow but joyous circling of the stage, a plie here and there, almost in the style of George Balanchine. She's reminding us of the Degas painting, ""The Ballet Class,"" but more in imitation of the teacher than any of the dancers.<br /><br />And so this delightful moment ends, as Aunt Agatha slips off into the wings and onto a chair, breathing heavily. I think we can all divine what Shake and Bake Original Pork is like from such a performance, but for those who missed the significance, I can say that from eating it, it's somewhat bland, but probably just what the target market expects.<br /><br />No doubt, when she gets her breath back, Aunt Agatha will delight us with more interpretations, but for now, we'll let her rest.

346184,B002P0Q14C,A1FLQ698D9C0C8,G. Zhang,0,2,5,1252800000,Tea Antioxidants,"Tea Antioxidants<br />----------------<br /><br />Antioxidants can help the body protect itself against free radicals--molecules that can damage cells. Antioxidants in tea called flavonoids can do that.<br /><br />Whether iced or hot, Teas made from real tea leaves provide more than great taste. Like fruits and vegetables, regular and decaffeinated brewed teas contain natural antioxidants called flavonoids* (10-22, 68, 69). Research suggests that antioxidants can be beneficial to health by helping the body protect itself from the harmful effects of ""free radicals"" (1-9, 26-30, 73-75). Free radicals, molecules which occur in the environment and are naturally produced by the body, can cause damage to cells. Chronic damage by free radicals is one factor thought to contribute to the development of many chronic diseases including heart disease or cancer. An average cup of brewed green or black tea has 150-200 mg of flavonoids (10-21).<br /><br />Currently, tea's potential health benefits are the focus of many scientific studies, and new research is emerging regularly. The American Dietetic Association in its Position Paper on Functional Foods included black and green tea as functional foods. Based on the available scientific research, the paper stated that the health benefits of drinking black or green tea include possible reduced risk for coronary heart disease, as well as gastric, esophageal and skin cancers (33). Tea and tea flavonoids have also been shown to help strengthen the body's immune system (34-43, 57-64), protect teeth by inhibiting plaque bacteria (44, 45, 56), potentially fight free radicals produced during strenuous exercise (76-80), and possibly increase calories burned during everyday activities (65, 66). While this emerging research is promising, more studies on the role of tea and tea antioxidants must be completed before drawing any conclusions about tea's contribution to health and wellness.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Heart Health Research<br />---------------------<br /><br />Heart disease is a major cause of preventable disease and death in all regions of the world. In America over 40% of all deaths are caused by heart disease which affects over 64 million men and women, almost one quarter of the US population (1). In light of such a high incidence of heart disease taking simple dietary steps to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease could have a significant impact on public health. As part of a healthy lifestyle regular tea drinking may help maintain a healthy heart.<br /><br />Current Research<br /><br />A number of population studies conducted around the world including studies in United States and Europe have consistently found that drinking black tea is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Three separate analyses of research showed that drinking three cups of tea daily reduced the risk for cardiovascular disease death or heart attack by about 10-12% (3, 4, 80).<br /><br />One of these analyses reviewed 17 population studies and assessed the effect of tea drinking on stroke, heart attack, and all types of coronary heart disease. Results showed that the rate of heart attack decreased by 11% among those who drank three cups of tea per day (3). A second analysis included seven studies and evaluated consumption of dietary flavonoids and risk of death from heart disease. Reported in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, investigators found a 20% reduction in risk of death from coronary heart disease among study participants who consumed the most dietary flavonoids (tea was the primary source of flavonoids) when compared to study participants who consumed the least dietary flavonoids(4). A third review of 10 studies showed that drinking around 3 cups of tea each day reduced the incidence of heart attack by 11% and reduced the rate of death from heart disease by 11% (80). Together, these studies show drinking tea regularly may help maintain a healthy heart as a part of a healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />How can tea do that?<br /><br />Since heart disease is a complex disease with multiple risk factors there are several possible roles tea may play that might explain the reduced risk of disease observed in people consuming black tea. Clinical studies have shown that tea flavonoids may promote good heart health by improving endothelial function (44, 45, 46) and by reducing blood cholesterol levels (64, 66, 68, 79).<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Tea and Body Protection<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />A healthy immune system protects the body from infection and disease. A number of test tube studies have shown that some flavonoids help immune response by acting as anti-allergic (135, 136, 137), anti-inflammatory (138, 139), anti-viral (140) and anti-bacterial agents (80, 141, 142, 143). Furthermore, flavonoids have been shown to modulate the function of blood cells that are relevant for the immune response (81) and in both human and animal studies flavonoids have been shown to fight bacteria (80, 141, 142, 143) and thus improve resistance to infection. In addition, cell studies have shown that flavonoids in black and green tea have anti-inflammatory properties (138, 139).<br /><br />Studies specifically on tea flavonoids in test tube and animal research found that tea flavonoids may help maintain proper immune response by helping control inflammation (138, 139, 144) and by reducing the production of proteins involved in inflammation (145). These properties suggest that tea flavonoids help improve resistance to infection. Research conducted in test tubes and small pigs suggests that tea flavonoids may also help sustain a healthy gastrointestinal tract by promoting the proper balance of bacteria in the colon (146, 147). Emerging research has also found that tea antioxidants can inhibit the growth of unhealthy bacteria and promote the growth of good bacteria in the gut. In addition, recent test tube-based studies have found that tea flavonoids can kill bacteria known to cause stomach ulcers (148, 80, 149).<br /><br />Theanine, a unique amino acid found in tea, activates specific cells involved in the ""first line of defense"" cells of the immune system, which may reduce the risk of viral and bacterial infections (127). This suggests that regular tea consumption may help support the body's immune system. Researchers from the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University recently published new data indicating that theanine can help the body ward off infection and disease and may strengthen the immune system (150). In a follow up human clinical trial, published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, these researchers showed that after drinking 20 ounces of black tea daily for two to four weeks, participant's immune cells produced two - four times more interferon. Interferon is a protein that helps strengthen or improve the body's immune response. Coffee had no effect on increasing the production of interferon (127). While research on effects of tea on the body's immune system and its potential to help protect the body is just emerging, experts are encouraged by these promising results.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Tea and Appearance<br />------------------<br /><br />The possibility that green tea helps with weight loss has been a recent topic in the media. What is the potential role of tea in helping maintain healthy weight? Unsweetened, fresh-brewed tea, both black and green has no sodium, no sugar, no fat and virtually no calories, yet tea is a satisfying, aromatic beverage. This makes tea an ideal choice for a weight control plan that is part of a healthy lifestyle, especially when substituting for other sugar sweetened beverages. Another factor to potentially helping maintain a healthy weight is that regular tea contains caffeine which has been shown to increase energy expenditure (number of calories burned)(17,18). In a study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, consumption of 3-4 servings of oolong tea was shown to increase energy expenditure and the rate of fat breakdown. In addition, subjects drinking tea spent energy at a 3% faster rate and burnt about 70 more calories a day than those consuming water (57).<br /><br />Some emerging research on energy expenditure conducted with tea and tea extracts has suggested that increases in metabolism and rate of fat breakdown may not be solely due to caffeine in the tea. One study measuring the effect of green tea extract on energy expenditure in people showed that drinking either caffeinated water or tea extract significantly increased the number of calories burned, but in addition the rate of fat breakdown was significantly higher for participants drinking tea extract than those drinking the caffeinated water(58). In a second study researchers looked at group of flavonoids in tea and its effect on weight loss and body fat. They found significant weight loss and a significant reduction in total body fat in the people drinking tea flavonoids (equal to 3-4 cups of tea per day) when compared to participants drinking the placebo (66).<br /><br />While this is active area of research; the preliminary evidence suggests the tea drinking can increase energy expenditure and fat burning. However, there are no conclusive studies that tea drinking has beneficial effects on weight loss. Still, tea is a satisfying, calorie-free beverage that can be substituted for sweetened beverages and is a delicious alternative to plain water in a healthy weight management plan.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Lipton's Unique History<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Sir Thomas Lipton was a Scottish-born entrepreneur and innovator who decided in 1880, at the age of 40, that he would make tea accessible to all at acceptable prices and with a guaranteed quality. Before Thomas Lipton, tea had been expensive. It was a beverage for the rich and variable in taste as a result of improper packaging and transportation. Thomas Lipton acquired tea estates in Ceylon (today Sri Lanka) and organized packaging and transportation at low cost to sell his teas 'direct from the tea garden to the tea pot'. In 1893, he established the Thomas J Lipton Co., a tea packing company with its headquarters and factory in Hoboken, New Jersey.<br /><br />LIPTON teas were an immediate success in the US. Thomas Lipton was knighted by Queen Victoria, who made him Sir Thomas Lipton in 1898 at the age of forty-eight.<br /><br />Thanks to Sir Thomas Lipton, LIPTON is the world's leading tea brand and present in more than 80 countries.<br /><br />LIPTON. The company that serves tea to the world.<br /><br /> Reinventing Tea<br />------------------<br /><br />Sir Thomas J. Lipton pioneered many practices in tea manufacturing and the company he founded has continued this tradition of quality and innovation:<br /><br />  * 1890: First manufacturer to buy his own tea estates to ensure quality and consistency<br />  * 1890: First manufacturer to sell tea exclusively in packages<br />  * 1906: Created first British blend of tea to be imported into Japan<br />  * 1910: First to use printed tags with brewing instructions<br />  * 1944: ""Brisk"" tea launched in US<br />  * 1954: LIPTON introduces the Flo-Thru double-chamber teabag<br />  * 1964 LIPTON Iced tea mix introduced in the US<br />  * 1972: LIPTON Iced tea in a can introduced in the US<br />  * 1999: LIPTON Cold Brew launched, iced tea prepared with real tea in cold water<br /><br />More than 100 years of ""firsts"" and innovations has enabled LIPTON to bring more tea enjoyment to more people in the world than any other tea company.Sir Thomas would be proud. But he wouldn't let us stop here. In that spirit of tireless inventiveness, research and discovery, LIPTON is helping to shed more light on the exciting health benefits of brewed black and green tea, including the protective qualities of flavonoid antioxidants.<br /><br />LIPTON. Constantly reinventing the way the world enjoys the goodness of tea."

(Traverse City bills itself as the cherry capitol of the world -whether it is remains to be seen - but they sure have a big cherry crop.)  This summer, I was unable to go to Michigan, and ran out of cherries in July.  Imagine my amazement (and happiness) when I found not only dried cherries at Amazon.com, but my actual brand - Traverse Bay cherries - and at a competitive price.  While this may look expensive to the uninitiated, 1/4 pound of dried cherries sells for about $8 at the gourmet or grocery stores.  Doing the math, that would put 4 pounds at $128.  Now... about the cherries, they are heavenly.  Put them in salads, in cookies instead of raisins (so much better), in your oatmeal, or just eat them with your fingers.  Tip:  transfer them to a zip-lock bag as soon as you open them.  They do tend to get hard if not kept zipped up.  I keep them in the pantry at room temp."

When making bread, I simply add a couple of teaspoons of the frozen yeast from the jar directly to the bread pan.  I have had the yeast keep for about four to six years (two 1 lb packages) without a problem. I'm nearing the end of my last (4th) pound and looked to Amazon for a replacement.

The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.

Our three cats don't love this ""dental diet cat food"" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats."

I would say the best in the west, it is organic, spicy, perfectly sweet, and made just north of me in Petaluma. Come on now, this is what I will want to eat when the next natural disaster hits.

The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I had been saving this matcha for the perfect time and after a day of singing I needed to bring it out.  Not to mention the fact that I could use a bit of a pick me up.<br />I decided to prepare this matcha hot first since I wanted to sooth my throat.  I added just a pinch of sugar and a generous helping of honey (I love my honey)!  I did take a sip before adding the honey just so I could get the original flavor.  This matcha is very smooth and spicy.  It is not in your face spicy, but just enough to give it a little flavor.<br />This matcha was very soothing on my throat so I think I'm going to save this one for next week when I have to sing again.  Sorry friends, no sharing of this one!<br />Red Leaf Tea mentions this for treating motion sickness when suffering from an unsettling stomach among other things so it's definitely useful for everyday use.  Think I might have to save a bit for my hubby to try.<br /> Here is how I ordered my Ginger Matcha from Red Leaf Tea:<br />Size: Small<br />Quality: Classic Starter Grade<br />Flavor: Delicate<br />Storage: Air tight refill flat pouch - would definitely recommend purchasing a tin for your matcha to keep it fresh.

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing. Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough.

You may find haribo soda-flavored gummies, but their taste is usually not as strong as the hard-candy substitutes, and the gelatin ingredient may be unwanted to certain people. This candy is interesting in that it has a very mild fizz in it. That said, the candy is is very rough on the tongue/palette (most likely due to this fizz-additive). Now taste-wise, I've had many cola-flavor candies, and this candy's taste is not as strong as say-- candyland's cola flavored candy.<br /><br />If you can find a lower price, then have at it, but at the price amazon has this candy listed, it's not worth it.

It is easily the best price fair trade and organic option on the market, unless you want something flavorless.<br /><br />I primarily make espresso and this bean puts all others to shame. It takes an average-fineness grind, fine but not powdery, and preferably a HOT portafilter. Double shots are best, as it really needs to heat up to get a fine emulsion and delivers excellent crema. Fantastic as espresso, with rich chocolatey notes and a superbly smooth feel. My wife, who enjoys cream and sugar with a bit of coffee, loves this in a latte with 1 part espresso and only 2 parts milk (usual latte is about 1 to 6). After using this for the past few months, when travelling and stopping at Starbucks or Caribou, it's disgusting to drink what used to pass for good coffee. This is the best bean you could ever want.<br /><br />On occassion, I've also brewed using a French press and, naturally, the result was fabulous. I usually find brewed coffee quite lacking in body and flavor, but this was rich, flavorful, and absent of acidity. I actually found it to taste best after steeping for 10-15 minutes, much longer than called for.<br /><br />Obviously this is for people who really love strong coffee. It is a dark, dark roast but the balance of body and acidity makes it a versatile option for the skilled barista.<br /><br />Still yet to check out the 454 Horespower roast, could be even better, but can't compare to the great value of Kick Ass. If you're bothering to look at this bean, then go ahead and buy it. You won't be disapointed."

I have to give my dog medicine on a daily basis and he takes them like treats using pill pockets. I normally buy the capsule (as opposed to tablet) size and just pull off as much as I need to cover the size pill Dexter has to take. This makes the product last longer. Dexter thinks they're a treat and just gobbles it down medicine and all.<br /><br />The one draw back for me is the smell of the Allergy formula pockets - it's pretty bad!

Yes, it is organic and gluten-free, but it also is a processed food containing a fair amount of sugar at 7g per serving (second ingredient is organic evaporated cane juice) and gets its fiber from added inulin (and maybe additional sweetening from this ingredient), rather than just from whole grains.  The major grain constituents of corn meal/flour and brown rice flour are not the healthiest grain ingredients but might be needed to get a decent gluten free cereal (this contains no oats, which are also gluten free).  The amount of fiber per serving is 3g, not too great for a healthy cereal.  This is not a fortified cereal, so Vitamin A, C and calcium are 0% and iron only 4% of RDA.<br /><br />The package is somewhat deceptive in that it lists a serving as having relatively low calories (110 calories), but the reason becomes evident when looking into the serving size.  The cereal serving size is 2/3c = 30g = 1.10 oz, which is smaller when compared to standard natural cereal serving sizes (which I have found to be more in the 1.5 to 1.8 oz range), so this is the reason that the calories appear lower.  Possibly this serving size may be more appropriate for children.  As an adult, eating only 1.10 oz of this cereal does not fill me up.<br /><br />The cereal tastes pretty good, if you like a sweet cereal, and I think kids would like this.  It appears to be a mixture of organic versions of Kix (hollow corn spheres), tiny Rice Krispies and some kind of fiber flakes, with tiny bits of other stuff (possibly sugar coated puffed quinoa etc).  Maybe it has a hint of vanilla flavor, but it mostly tasted sweet to me.  It was quite good with fresh sliced strawberries on top and regular milk.  The cereal did not appear as appetizing as the glossy photo on the package.<br /><br />The box is only 10.6oz, so it won't last long if increasing the amount per serving and thus is not the best value.  I suppose this cereal may be a good option for people who need a tasty/sugary gluten-free cereal.  But there certainly are healthier and cheaper options out there (even standard oatmeal).  Rated 2 1/2 stars, rounded down to 2 stars."

Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet.

I was very sad when Costco's Kirkland brand stopped selling their tomato soup, which i just loved. I learned it was actually made by the Campbell's Company, but the ingredients appeared to be specially mixed for Costco, and I've found no equivalent in other Campbell's many tomato soup offerings, which don't taste so good. I don't know why Kirkland's canned tomato soup disappeared from my Costco, but it has now been a long, sad, taste journey for me, through many many cans of brands and tubs of specialty-type tomato soups. I was a bit leary of the Wolfgang Puck label, because I tried one soup variety previously, and found it extremely salty.  However, this was on sale, and i had not found a reasonable tomato soup substitute.<br /><br />so, WOW.  i'm so relieved i found this soup. It's delish and rich. The consistency is great (smooth, but with texture) and you can really taste the blend of cream and butter that really complements the tomato to make the overall flavor soooo delicious--almost cheesy (my son asked if I had added parmesan).  it's also a great plus that the ingredients are simple and clean (and organic). I heartily recommend this soup. i certainly will be ordering it from now on using subscribe and save.  Great job, Mr. Puck."

My husband has seen the bad side affects of flax seed (swollen prostate), but none from chia yet. Some studies suggest not just swelling, but cancer is a risk for men. I'm not fully convinced chia seeds can cause prostate cancer (in the quantity we eat them) but this is something you may want to consider if you're a man or cooking for a man. I'm doing more and more research on it and will update here if I find out more.<br /><br />Chia seeds are considered to be very healthy and can be added to just about any foods & recipes (tastes a little like nutty cracked pepper). I usually buy Spectrum and Nutiva brand but I also trust Bob's Red Mill. They all offer quality products. I have never got a ""bad"" or rancid batch of chia seeds from any of these companies and have purchased from all of them for many years. I've purchased Bob's and Spectrum chia locally and Nutiva chia here on Amazon.com. If you can't get Bob's Red Mill locally I would recommend you go through Amazon since I use Amazon for hundreds of purchases and customer service is always great.<br /><br />The price of Chia Seeds has gone up as much as 300% (most brands) in the last 18 months due to popularity and is expected to rise even more very soon. This Spectrum 12 oz bag seems to be the lowest price I've seen on Amazon lately. Personally I'm going to stock up since the prices are going so high so fast. If you want to eat chia daily I advise others do the same if you can afford to. Waiting will most likely just mean you'll pay more later. They can be frozen for long term storage, or vacuum sealed.<br /><br />I add chia seeds to my husbands meat dishes to give him the added nutrients and antioxidants he does not get otherwise.<br />I add chia to just about all foods I eat, just a little in everything. I sprinkle them over Salads and Veggies like cracked pepper.<br /><br />I've added Chia Seeds to the following recipes/foods with great results:<br />Oatmeal<br />Meat Loaf & Meatballs (regular meat or tofu)<br />Sauces & Gravies<br />Baked Cakes, Cookies, Muffins, Pastries<br />Ice Creams, Sherbets, Sorbets<br />Smoothies<br />Soups<br />Scrambled Eggs & Omelets<br />Bread Crumbs<br /><br />Use just a little and you can barely taste them (good for a start).<br />Use a bit more and it will have a nutty peppery flavor.<br />For example, I have to mix at least 1/2 cup of Chia seeds per 7 pounds of ground meat before my husband will even begin to taste it.<br />Keep in mind the idea of eating Chia seeds is not so much for the flavor as it is for the nutrients.<br /><br />If you grind the Chia seeds to a powder (using a coffer grinder or similar) this will release the nutrients and give you more benefit from them.<br /><br />Studies have shown adding Chia seeds to your daily diet can help fight cancer, boost your immune system, and flush toxins from your body.<br /><br />For those who want to (or need to) eat a grain-free diet, Chia seeds are not considered to be a true ""cereal"" grain, and therefore is an acceptable ""grain"" or seed to eat if you're on a Paleo or similar diet.<br /><br />Chia seeds are high in protein (it's a complete protein), omega 3 fatty acids, calcium, boron (for bone health), fiber, potassium, and antioxidants."

It tasted good before adding the turmeric, I did not expect the flavor to improve. I add one teaspoon of turmeric powder to my protein drink that uses a fruit juice base. I use a Whole Foods organic fruit juice blend of pineapple, orange and banana. The protein powders are from Vibrant Health: Pure Green Protein (vanilla flavor), Green Vibrance and Rainbow Vibrance.<br /><br />- Added to soups. I have tried this with various lentil soups and a chunky tomato soup. All very successful improvements in flavor, in addition to getting the health benefits.

My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...coffee I mean. Oh by the way, for a tasty hot chocolate beverage, try Celestial Seasonings ""Tuscanny"" 1 bag made strong, followed by 2 pkgs Carnation Instant Hot Chocolate, with mini marshmellows, and hot water in a tall to-go insulated mug.

The feed store didn't have anything pure venison, so I got this instead. I have no idea how my dog would have reacted to this food, if he would still be allergic or not because he flat-out refused to eat it. He went a day and a half without eating anything, and getting worried, I put back down the food I knew he was allergic to. He gobbled it up the second the bowl touched the floor, so I know he was hungry, just not wanting to eat this food. I know the old food didn't have anything to do with it either, because after that fiasco, I special ordered California's Best new venison formula food, and my dog loved it. He just doesn't like bison apparently, which is odd because the food he was on was the red meat formula of EVO. I would think going from beef to bison wouldn't be that big a change, but it was to my dog's nose. So I'm giving it three out of five stars; this might be a good food health-wise, but smell-wise, it turned my dog off to the point he was willing to starve himself rather than eat it, and he's a food motivated dog. He never turns his nose up to anything. Oh, and if it matters to anyone, my dog is a 65 pound boxer/catahoula mix."

It was quite good and took only four minutes to prepare. The sweet and sour taste was very good. It was too high in sodium, of course, which is typical of these prepared bowls. Probably half the packet of flavoring is salt. So, I watch my salt intake for the rest of the day when I have one of these. On the other hand, it had 6 grams of protein, which was high for a dish like this. All in all, it made a good, but not a great, lunch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

I previously ordered in 2009 and, again, in 2010. In both of those cases, the product came in a package of different design that contained 25 bags per box. I paid $21 in 2009 and $25 in 2010 (for six packages, in each case); thus, the price has not changed significantly in the past few years.<br /><br />Two days ago I found a lonely box of this tea hidden in the back of my cupboard, and, while it bears an ""enjoy by"" date of May 2011, it is still tasty as of this writing in February of 2012.<br /><br />I agree with the other two reviewers: this is a nice tea (and one can also enjoy it as an iced tea). It has a wonderful flavor, and seems to have a soothing effect on my aching knees... so much so, that, after feeling the positive effects of this tea for the first time, and believing that that ""healing"" effect might be a result of the eleuthero, the second-listed ingredient, I actually bought eleuthero capsules to use as a daily supplement. As they did not seem to be as effective in easing the pain in my knees, I am reordering the tea and skipping the supplements.<br /><br />According to Good Earth's own blurb from my previous purchases, this tea contains no caffeine... how they manage that with green tea, I am not sure. I am also not sure why they feel the need to add natural flavors (containing soy lecithin) as the third ingredient.<br /><br />Besides the benefit of what I believe to be this tea's ""healing properties"", it is just a wonderful tea to enjoy with friends after dinner.<br /><br />The old container was made from 100% recycled materials.

I am also an almond lover and eat a small handful of dry roasted, unsalted almonds nearly every day.  So, when I saw dark chocolate cocoa-roasted almonds offered on amazon, it seemed a match made in heaven. :)<br /><br />What surprised me most, I think, about these delicious cocoa-roasted almonds is that they are not over sweet (only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving).  I worried that they would taste like candy and that is not something I need more of (I am already slave enough to the Sweet Monster!).<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise was that the almonds are not salty.  I have hypertension and need to limit my salt so, when the almonds arrived and I reviewed the nutrition label, I was pleased to see that they only have 25 mg of sodium per 1/4 cup serving and that they are made with dry-roasted vs. oil-roasted almonds.<br /><br />In my chocoholic fervor while ordering, I hadn't paid attention to what size cannister the almonds would come in, so I was again pleasantly surprised to find that they came in a generous 11 oz. cannister.<br /><br />I had some friends over last weekend and put out a dish of the almonds on the table.  I lost count of how many times I heard ""Mmm! These are GOOD!"" but I know that the dish was nearly empty when they left."

So, I'm one of those superficial ""Friends don't let friends drink Starbucks"" pseudo-snobs. Nothing against the product quality. Just against the idea and presenation (I still say ""small,"" ""medium,"" or ""large"" whenever I go there. Sometimes they're the only game in town. Can't bring myself to use the Startalk names)<br /><br />Today, I tried one because I was too tired to grind and drip. Surprisingly, this stuff tastes pretty good for instant coffee. Naturally, not as good as fresh ground, but still pretty good. After reading up on it, I suppose the difference is between the microgrind and the traditional freeze-drying.<br /><br />So, yes, I'd drink this coffee again. But at the price, I'm not likely to buy it often. Or ever. Trader Joe's has a similar type of instant coffee for much less. Maybe for camping trips, but I'll try others before buying the Starbucks brand.<br /><br />Five stars for the product quality, as far as instant coffee goes.

Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat.<br /><br />The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either. I could have went to the supermarket and bought a prime rib on sale that tasted better than this was, which i have in the past, and didn't spend nearly as much as they charged."

First, if you care it's post have lower amount of packaging than comparable products and be better for the environment. Anyway, the thing I really do like about this is the pouches are also the measuring cup. You take a bowl, tear the pouch open, dump out the contents, then you fill be empty pouch with water up to a line on the pouch, dump it in the bowl, stir and then nuke it for 90 seconds. I don't know why nobody is ever thought of this before in any of the packaging I've seen, but it saves the guessing at how much water to put in or caring stupid measuring cup around with you if you're eating it work like I do. My only minor gripe is the line it asks you to tear at isn't the area that had the tear point so I mistook the tear line for the fill line and put in too much water the first four or five times I used it.<br /><br />When we went back to the store we picked up another three boxes pulled me out for the next few weeks.

It is a good, solid selection.<br /><br />The basket was nice and had leather loops for hands. I've repurposed that to hold the bits and pieces that collect around my desk at work.

In fact, if you have a friend who travels a lot, this may be a great gift bcause of the individual packaging.

Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good.  My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia seeds, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it.  Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace.  One of the primary contributors to their physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds.  I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia seeds, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Buy some Chia seeds and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible."

257351,B0029NLV8G,A2FBIW0WJU5X3Y,Babsbny earned her Masters,1,1,4,1282176000,Four Paws up,"I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on."

They are now available at many more stores than when I ordered a box from Amazon awhile ago. And they are much cheaper at every store I've been to than the online price. At even Whole Foods, I typically pay $1.69 per bar, and get a slight discount for buying an entire box. Once you add shipping to Amazon's prices, they are more expensive online. Also, keep in mind the season when ordering them. All of the coatings had melted and were stuck to the packaging, then fell off in pieces when opened, due to having melted during shipment. But if you can get them locally, give them a try. There are many flavors to choose from, though most stores seem to only carry a few.<br /><br />Those people who claim they are awful tasting probably haven't tried other protein bars that are low-carb and gluten-free, and expect them to taste like candy bars or high-sugar bars that may be more tasty, but are also full of ingredients that render them nutritionally useless."

I recently broke down and bought one of these toys and she loves it as well!  I've limited her to one treat every two weeks, since they are not cheap and I don't know the caloric density of these treats and like to keep her weight well regulated.  In the between times, I place treats/kibble inside the ball and she flings it around the apartment to get them out.  I've had to take the Everlasting Treat Ball away from her on occasion because she WILL NOT STOP eating the treat and starts to get frustrated that she CAN'T GET IT OUT!  She has popped out the treats occasionally but only after several hours of chewing and licking it beforehand.  It's nice to have something I can give her that will keep her occupied.<br /><br />TIP: Make sure you get the right size!  Otherwise, it will be more likely that your dog can pop the treats out.  I bought Cora a LARGE.<br /><br />TIP: Put the treats in upside-down!  This trick was mentioned by someone else who commented, and it definitely works for my dog.  It is a lot more difficult for her to pop out the treat if the convex side is toward the center of the ball and the flat surface is exposed.  She does get a bit more frustrated with the toy if I do this though, so I have to watch her more carefully to make sure she's not chewing up the toy just the get the treat!<br /><br />TIP: I tried the fire hydrant version of this toy first, but Cora chewed the edges off around the treat in order to get it out faster.  So... it died.  This one is much more durable since it doesn't have the same sort of ""lip"" around the edge."

I've received numerous complaints regarding bad breath from my girlfriend, and have discovered a noticeable increase in salivation as well as unsightly hair growth. I've read that many dogs have choked, gagged, and even puked while eating these hygiene chews. Unfortunately I can report the same problems during human consumption. This is mainly because they are a little too big to be swallowed whole, and sometimes when you're eating especially vivaciously they'll tend to slowly clog your throat if you forget to swallow often enough, triggering your gag reflex. It does merit three stars however, because they taste DELICIOUS. The taste itself is worth the negative side-effects. I've seen no reviews so far covering effects on humans, so I just thought I'd throw in a few of own my personal experiences."

The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?"

29552,B000PDY3P0,ASY25YMTIC2A9,Steve,1,2,3,1306800000,Varying Freshness Ruins What Could Be Great Popcorn,"My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand."

It actually has 220 calories in only one bar and also has some saturated fat so it's not for people who are looking for a diet snack. Also, half its calories come from fat (110 out of 220). The second ingredient says corn syrup so that kind of gives you an idea of this bar's target audience.<br /><br />They come in a box so if Amazon is selling these as a set of 10 boxes.

I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />You can use the vanilla beans, rinse and dry them, so they last longer. After drying, you can store them again in the glass tube or in their own plastic bag for reuse.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

When I started noticing that the dressing was only there ""sometimes"", I would buy all of the bottles of it--partly because I was afraid they were going to quit stocking it, and partly because I wanted Wally to see that this stuff is profitable for them to stock.<br /><br />No matter. It's gone, for good.  It has a terrific, tangy flavor without having too strong a bite. It was hard to keep around this house. Now I can't even get it to bring to the house.<br /><br />I am going to hold my breath and order it online, and just hope that what has happened to others (wrong dressing, way past expiration, etc.) won't happen to me.  If it's close to the expiration date, I'll keep it anyway, because we really use it up, especially during gardening season.  The stuff tastes just fine a couple months past the expiration date, too, if it hasn't been opened.  I think the reason for the date is that the quality supposedly starts to deteriorate, not because it's ""rotten"".  Though, I've never noticed any deterioration in quality.<br /><br />I sure wish I could duplicate this recipe at home.<br /><br />Update:  The bottles of this dressing that I ordered from Amazon weren't anywhere close to the expiration date, and is good as always."

The flavor is pretty good, but as others have said, there's no real honey taste. It tastes more like a sugar-free Crystal Light mix.

I'm a lover of real cheese too, but there's a special place in my heart for processed liquidy cheese-flavored food stuffs. They should really get a category of its own (powdered cheese product, nacho queso, and Velveeta all fall into this delightful category of cheese based non-cheeses.)  Anyway, I love Velveeta piping hot and poured over broccoli, but if you've ever eaten Velveeta and let it cool, you're familiar with the plastic-like texture the Velveta takes on.  It's the same here - you have to eat this meal while it's HOT.  Otherwise, don't bother.  Leftovers are good too - just be sure to nuke it to as hot as you can get it.<br /><br />The instructions call for one breast of chicken.  I feed hungry people, so I added two.  The dehydrated broccoli packet was disappointing, so I also added a fresh head of broccoli to the skillet a little earlier so it could steam in the water.  This was a great move - the fresh broccoli REALLY improves the dinner kit, but it's fine without it.  The pasta to chicken/broccoli ratio was a little low because of my additions, but the pasta is like an orzo anyway, so I didn't mind it.<br /><br />Would I eat this once a week?  Probably not.  Would I buy this again?  Probably - it's like keeping a can of pasta sauce in your pantry.

Fortunately, Amazon is making it right but I am saddened by this problem with planters.<br /><br />Jan 8, 2012: Update, for a while in 2011 there were bad patches of these nuts where for some reason the hot chili pepper was missing making the flavor subpar - there are several reviews mentioning this and I have personally experienced a few of these packs which I could not enjoy. Anyway, last week I received my latest Subscribe and Save order from Amazon and I am pleased to report that the tried and true recipe was used for that batch - dated best by 7-31-12.<br /><br />My favorite snack is nuts, particularly pistachios, almonds, cashews and peanuts - Yes, I know peanuts are not nuts but a legume. This particular variety of planters nuts are my favorite and can be hard to find, especially now that they have all these new designer flavors, most of which I just don't like at all. Chipotle has an aftertaste I don't enjoy and the other new flavors are too strong or too salty. The regular, honey roasted and heat nuts are the only varieties I enjoy. Heat nuts are not too hot, but certainly not mild. The hot spices heat up the taste of a roasted peanut instead of masking it.<br /><br />Nuts are far more nutritious than potato chips or pretzels which are mostly empty calories. Nuts are also loaded with fat, good fat, which makes you feel full instead of spiking your insulin levels like non-fat snacks do. But keep in mind a few nuts contain plenty of calories and it is easy to just keeping eating your way to the next size pants. The good news is that each packet, about 300 calories, makes for good portion control. Eat one pack and stop. Amazon has a great price and free shipping. If you like nuts and like hot and spicy, you'll love Heat Peanuts."

I tried making some of the salad dressing recipes listed on the back of the jar, but I couldn't actually taste the herbs in them. So I started doing my own experimenting with the seasoning mix. I've found that I now cannot eat macaroni and cheese without it adding the dry mix to it after cooking. However, I did not like the taste when I added the dry mix to vegetables after cooking. I think the reason is that the real trick to get to the heart of the flavor of this mix is to hydrate it. It's great cooked into things rather than merely sprinkled on top. Mixed with olive oil, this makes the best bread dip that I've had from a mix (even better than Carraba's).

I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have ""turned on to"" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet."

I used it every single day when we were making purees (my son is now into the chunkier meals) and I still use the steamer option to this day to make steamed apples and pears. Yes, you can probably get the same effect with a traditional steamer basket, pot, hot water and blender. But that's the beauty of this little machine. It's all 3 things in one which means less clean up too.<br /><br />pros:<br />* EASY TO USE - the beaba babycook is super easy to use. The first couple tries I found myself having to think about each step (measure water level, pour water, align basket, align lid, turn knob to steam) but after a few times, you completely get the hang of it.<br /><br />* LIQUID RESERVES - so one of the best things I found about the beaba is that you can save the liquid from the steaming process and use it to mix in with other foods. For example, whenever I steam apples or pears, I save the liquid that's collected on the bottom and mix it in with oatmeal for an apple/pear oatmeal bowl. This is something that I found I can't do with a traditonal steamer/pot and blender. Any root vegetables, I would discard the liquid (mainly because of my fear of pesticides and such) but everything else, I would keep the liquid and mix it in with foods.<br /><br />* EASY TO CLEAN - the only things you have to clean are the steam basket, blender pot, and lids. They're dishwasher safe too so it can't get any easier than that.<br /><br />cons:<br />* SMALL BASKET - you can only cook a small amount of food at any time. I found that I could only fit around half a potato (diced) at a time. This wasn't a big issue for me because it only takes around 5-6 minutes for the steam to be done. But there were times that I used the traditional steamer basket/pot to steam 2-3 whole potatoes at once (for the freezer) and used the beaba blender to puree.<br /><br />* STAINS - the plastic material is a bit porous so you will see stains (especially from carrots and beets). The plastic steam basket will DEFINITELY stain. Mine is an orangey-color, from the carrots and sweet potatos.<br /><br />* EXPENSIVE - it is quite costly and it's really hard to find these on sale. If you plan on using it for one kid, I would reconsider. If you plan on using it for more than one kid, might be worth the investment.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very glad I made the purchase. Not only is it functional, it looks super cute on your kitchen counter. And makes the baby food making process that much more ""fun""."

Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.  This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of."

Our pediatrician recommended this milk alternative, and she said it was fine to give him the flavored/sweetened stuff.

I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.

I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like ""gluten free"" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing."

Okay, so, that song is the only real reference to brandy I have, and that's not even the right brandy. Well, that song and the singer from the 90s...anyway. In college, one of my roommates liked to mix (cheap, horrible) brandy with her cola when she drank, and so I've had a few of those, but that's really it. I'm a whisky girl, through and through. That's what happens when you go to high school in Tennessee and college in Kentucky. But it looked interesting and I liked the brandy I've had, so I thought ""why not?"" If nothing else, it will be good for mixing with the apple matcha. Or the cola matcha, for when I'm having a bad day at work and need a drink but can't have one just yet. At least I can pretend. But I don't really have a flavor profile in mind when I try this matcha, so it will be an interesting experience. For instance, when I try a pineapple tea, I have in mind what I think a pineapple should taste like and I can match the tea up to that flavor profile and see how it compares. With this, I'm just shooting in the dark, though I'm sure I'll be comparing it to whisky before this review is done.<br /><br />Oh wow, this is good. This is goooood. Yes, the unnecessary ""o""s were necessary. It's fruity and smooth and...yum. I don't quite know how to describe it. It's not what I was expecting out of brandy, but I don't really have any experience with brandy, so what do I know? I can almost taste a touch of alcohol, but that might just be my imagination. It does seem warming, which is odd since I'm drinking it cold. I love cold matcha and how easy it is to mix. Add water to matcha powder, whisk/froth, and go! Done! Yum. Saves me a ton of time in the mornings when I'm barely awake and trying to get ready for work.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. If this is what brandy tastes like, I need to try some as soon as possible. I think my father in law has some...it might be time to hang out with the in laws. It tastes kind of like bubble gum but...juicy fruit gum, not double bubble. Definitely one I plan to keep around."

It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.

There is not enough clearance.  Also, the drawer is not long enough to hold 7 per each of the 5 rows like advertised.  Again, the measurement if off slightly so it will only hold 6 (for a total of 30) with a little room left over so they do not fit snug.  Which leads to the 3rd problem:  with 2 rails instead of a solid bottom or mesh to sit on, the k-cups tilt so, again, with the poor clearance, they get hung up when you try to open or close the drawer.  Regretfully, this is not as advertised and not measured property to use for k-cups.  I am really not hard to please, but this is way wrong at any price."

I will have to take their word that there was 20 lbs inside.  Approx. half of the ""wafers"" were broken or shredded.

It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt."

When the machine is steaming & applying the pressure to the milk pod, you get a faint aroma of vanilla as the mug fills. The flavor is delicate and doesn't overwhelm the rest of the coffee. I like a sweet drink so I have to add a hit of sugar to all of coffees, so while it says it's a lightly sweetened latte, they really mean LIGHTLY. The main thing I do like is that Nescafe is not using fake sweeteners (like splenda etc)so you don't get a funky aftertaste with any of the flavors.

This shouldn't be confused with the arsenic that they will tell you ""occurs naturally"" if you call.  Inorganic arsenic is a know carcinogen and shouldn't be in anything labeled organic.  Earth's Best rice baby cereal had the highest arsenic content of three brands tested.  However, when I called them, I was disappointed by their lack of accountability and misleading information they provided, especially because their marketing (see above) goes on at length about the health benefits of organic, pesticide free products.  They continue to claim that the product is safe, that arsenic occurs naturally, and they don't apply pesticides.  However, they cover up the fact that the inorganic arsenic in question is not ""naturally occurring,"" it is pesticide-derived and likely comes from pesticide residue in the soil.  I asked if they planned to do testing of their own, implement safety measures and provide refunds to customers who choose not to poison their baby, but they said no.  My opinion is that this ""organic"" product that is supposedly grown ""without harmful pesticides"" should be recalled and relabeled until they can show that it's arsenic-free.  If you are buying this by the case and feeding it frequently to your baby, you may be unintentionally poisoning them."

I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.<br /><br />Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.<br /><br />Just don't do what I did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses, what a horrible mess, the cookies looked normal, slightly lighter than normal, but the smell!

Start the puppy out on the puppy nylabones.  Follow instructions and help the pup's interest level by smearing some peanut butter on it, and so on.<br /><br />The first time we saw a Galileo Bone,  we were mystified,  but the sales clerk said he had one and it lasted years!  And guess what?  It did!  Our dog is over 8 years old now,  and has two Galileo's.  He doesn't chew on them constantly,  but whenever he feels like it.  It helps keep his molars free of tartar and satisfies his craving to chew.<br /><br />One of the bone's 3 tips was getting chewed waaaay close to the stump and finally broke off.  According to instructions,  that's the time to retire it and get a new one.<br /><br />I've paid over $20 each for these and feel they were worth it at that price.  Now they are almost half that.  Good deal.<br /><br />Natural (real) bones are dangerous and rawhide chews can get stuck in the throat,  swell in the stomach and even cause bowel impaction.  Don't use them.  If you insist,  supervise the dog so you can assist if the above problems happen.  It has happened to us.<br /><br />But use Nylabones and don't worry about it!

66958,B000KND8RY,A1TQIPT2QBAS6Z,Ddanimal,19,27,1,1297036800,"Agave ""nectar"" is a scam","from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you."

I was a little wary of this canned coffee mix at first. Opening it the first time and the dry mix smells like chocolate cake mix with a faint hint of peppermint. Adding the hot water to the mug with the dry mix in the bottom was wonderful. The bright smell of peppermint wafted up followed by a weaker scent of chocolate. I did the four teaspoons to 7 ounces of hot water per the instructions and the flavor was weak. Adding a bit more mix fixed the problem. The flavor overall is mild and smooth - no funky after taste of any kind. There is a tingle of peppermint on the tongue after you swallow and I really like that. One thing I really like is no artificial sweeteners - just sugar. I truly detest the flavor & aftertaste of the artificial sweeteners, so a product like this with just regular, natural sugar is always welcome.<br /><br />The only reason for removing a single star is due to the need to add more mix - otherwise it's sort of watery.

B Vitamins provide energy, something most of us need in this stressful, sleep deprived age we live in.  The consistency of Splenda with B Vitamins is the same as regular Splenda. It's almost like sifted powdered sugar.  It is very sweet by itself, but two Splendas in my tea turns out perfectly.  I don't taste any difference between Splenda and Splenda with B Vitamins.  The packaging of Splenda with B Vitamins is different, though.  The packets are foil lined and a lot thicker than the regular packets.  This means they hold up longer in your purse, but they are also a pain because you have to dump each one individually, rather than all at once.  I love Splenda with B Vitamins and highly recommend it."

Add the vinegar, lemon juice, mustard and all the remaining powdered seasonings.  Blend until it is well mixed.  Stir in the parsley and basil.<br />Pour the blended dressing over the ingredients in the bowl and marinate them covered at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.<br />Saut&eacute; the crawfish in ¼ cup olive oil and Cajun seasoning about 5-7 minutes.  Even though there will be other seasoning mixed with the tortellini, each individual crawfish needs its own spiciness.  You don't want those crawfish to get lonesome.  After you saut&eacute; them long enough to catch the seasoning, set them aside to cool.<br />Cook the tortellini according to the package directions.  Cook it al dente.  Drain it in the colander and allow it to cool.<br />Toss the crawfish, tortellini, and raisins with the vegetable mixture.<br />When you serve the salad, place it over the greens.  Garnish it with feta cheese.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Cumin is believed to help with digestion, to be a natural laxative, to relieve insominia, to help with bronchitis, and to prevent the common cold."

I became curious about the medicinal applications of licorice and searched ""licorice health"". I was stunned to find that licorice root and extract are implicated in a number of potentially serious health problems: hypertension, potassium depletion, heart and kidney failure,  fluid retention and swelling of the face and limbs, hormonal imbalance, and muscle destruction leading to pain and weakness. Licorice can reduce thyroid gland activity and lower basal metabolic rate. Pregnant women should avoid licorice because of danger to the fetus. From the ""People's Pharmacy"" web site:<br /><br />""It appears that individuals vary considerably in their susceptibility to adverse reactions from licorice. Some people experience negative symptoms within days, while others may ingest excessive licorice in candy, chewing gum, chewing tobacco, or herbal medicine for months or even years before they realize that they are suffering damaging effects. Women appear to be somewhat more susceptible than men, and oral contraceptives may increase this sensitivity.<br /><br />Paralysis of the legs (and in one case, of all of the limbs) has been reported. A sixty-four-year-old man developed pulmonary edema, signaled by fatigue and trouble breathing, after eating four packages of black Twizzlers licorice candy in three days. This case demonstrates how quickly a serious reaction can arise.""<br /><br />Interestingly, most licorice candy sold in the US is made with anise, not licorice flavoring. RJ's however is made from licorice extract... tasty but not worth the risk to me personally as one with a family history of circulatory disorders. Be aware."

After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do."

The flavor is good, it just isn't bacon. The two flavors are ingredients right on the label. Imitation Bacon-Bits have more of a bacon flavor. If they had just added the flavoring from them (even if it made it no longer vegetarian) it would have worked much better.<br /><br />It works better wet. Dry, you can barely taste it. It might make a good steak rub, I didn't try. $5 for the small container isn't bad, however the prices going for the large container are just a ripoff. There is definite salt in this. It's the first ingredient, sea salt, so bear this in mind if you are using it to season something.<br /><br />The flavor is good, I just cannot rate it higher as it does not taste like bacon, what it claims to and is named after."
334152,B000FA15PE,A1WT1RLV6KTMY2,Current Resident,3,5,1,1336780800,Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food,"People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the ""Fat Free"" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type ""snackwell devil food nutrition facts"" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that ""Fat Free"" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other ""health-conscience"" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore ""helpful review"" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics."
532520,B003GTOIUU,A3EALB9ULXTD5C,Amy,6,7,1,1278028800,Meh...,"I was really looking forward to trying this product. I thought it was going to be something new and different, but in the end, it was very disappointing. This was a surprise since I really enjoy most of Kraft products.<br /><br />The pack includes: dry macaroni, a seasoning/thickener packet, dry bread crumbs and a soft Velveeta-like cheese product.<br /><br />You provide 1/2 cup 2% milk, 2 TBLS. unsalted butter, and 1/2 shredded cheddar for the optional ""oven bake"" method.<br /><br />The difference between Kraft Homestyle Macaroni and Kraft Deluxe is all the additional steps: make the white sauce, add the cheese packet, top with shredded cheddar, bread crumbs and bake it off for 10 minutes at 425. I followed the directions, but something was telling me it needed a lot of help (Dijon, a pinch of garlic and cayenne, a little more butter and maybe some Worcestershire)<br /><br />I should have followed my instincts, because the end result was bland and tasteless. Nothing like real home style macaroni and cheese. The best part of these types of dishes is always the crunchy crumb topping, but even that was flavorless and mediocre. The bread crumbs have a stale quality, but my product was far away from the expiration date.<br /><br />Basically, I could have taken the same amount of time made a better product with Kraft 2% sharp cheddar, my own white sauce, seasonings and bread crumbs.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I really feel this product is pointless. The original Kraft Deluxe is such a good product on it's own, so creamy and delicious and comforting. This is just a strange mix of stove top and baked that doesn't really work.<br /><br />p.s. *Update*<br />Along with 4-cheese, I also got the ""Classic Cheddar"" flavor and finally made it a few days ago. I decided not to bake this one. Instead, I pan toasted the crumbs adding a little butter and 3 tsp of Parmesan/Romano mix. I made the cheese sauce as directed, but added a tiny drop of Dijon, black pepper and a dash of onion and garlic powders, then mixed it with the cooked macaroni and a sprinkle of sea salt (you may not need it, but I felt it was very bland). I topped one serving with 1/4 of  breadcrumbs and got a better finished product...more flavorful and creamy, but still not all that great of a product."

Newstone,16,31,1,1246492800,Quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased in my life,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned."

424935,B0041CIP3M,A2NUBL2UYWPBWR,C,1,1,5,1328486400,Authentic Singaporean curry-in-a-packet.,"Having spent a decent amount on time in SE Asia (and Singapore specifically) during my childhood, I frequently get cravings for Singaporean-style curry, hawker food and snacks.  As a result I am constantly on a hunt for fresh and authentic ingredients when and where I can get them to attempt to reproduce those dishes at home.  I even have friends send spice mixes and tinned pastes  from Singapore when the markets here fail me.<br /><br />What makes this curry-in-a-packet so good is that it has 2 separate pouches for the spice mix and for the coconut mix. This ensures freshness and authentic flavour when the coconut is added to the mix at the correct moment during the cooking process.  Also, other Singaporean brands do not include the coconut  mixture (requiring additional purchases) or the coconut is already added (affecting flavour).  Prima Taste is one of many curry packets available in Singapore and has a loyal following for its authentic spices.  This is one of the brands that I am sent if my Singaporean friends don't use it all up first!<br /><br />Needless to say, I am really happy that Prima Taste is now available in N. America and through Amazon.<br /><br />To sum:<br />+ Authentic spices in a vacuum-packed pouch<br />+ Pouch of correct amount of coconut mixture (coconut milk plus fresh shredded coconut). So there is no need to buy a separate can of coconut milk and shredded coconut to be partially used.<br />+ All-in-one - just add meat<br />+ No need to hunt down separate ingredients.<br /><br />The only CON is that the prices are double that of Singapore but hopefully should come down as more people discover Prima Taste."

Mallomars consist of a round graham cracker, with marshmallow on top, and then covered in pure chocolate (the chocolate is the reason Nabisco gives for only selling Mallomars in the Fall and Winter - they claim the chocolate will melt on store shelves or in transport during the warmer months). Two cookies equal 120 calories.<br /><br />Although we don't go so far as stockpiling them, Mallomars are a favorite in my family. The combination of chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker is perfect. Although the marshmallow is by far the most prominent taste, it is not overwhelming. The chocolate is delicious and the graham crackers are nice and soft. The cookies have a nice light taste, so they don't sit heavy in your stomach (they are round and about the size of a silver dollar but very satisfying).

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.

At least TOTW is the best priced of the premium, grain-free foods. Of course, a good price would mean nothing if the cats don't like it...yeah right, they literally face plant in the bowls when we put it out for them.<br /><br />Some people complain that the second ingredient listed is peas and not another meat ingredient.  Am I concerned?  Not really; the ordering of ingredients tells me little about how much chicken meal is present, only that there is more chicken than peas.  Lets look at two completely fake (and utterly unrealistic) scenarios to demonstrate this point:<br /><br />Cat Food #1 has 40% chicken meal, 20% peas, and a bunch of other stuff<br />Cat Food #2 has 20% chicken meal, 20% turkey meal, 20% peas, and a bunch of other stuff<br /><br />Although peas are the second ingredient listed for Cat Food #1, it has the same meat content as Cat Food #2, which lists meat as the first two ingredients.  Does TOTW have more or less meat that the other premium brands?

If they don't tell you, or you couldn't tell from the photo, these are MINI-CHOCOLATE CHIPS! My bags didn't have the words ""Mini Chips"", and no picture, so the manufacturer is in the process of learning/updating. They taste good/fine/chocolately when you eat them out of the bag. But, when you bake them into cookies, be prepared to make a smaller batch(use less flour, etc.), or use more than one bag! I was REALLY disappointed! I couldn't taste them at all! Because of how they tasted in hand, I thought they would be fine, but most recipes call for 2 cups chocolate chips = 1 bag of chocolate chips. Those are 12 oz bags. These are 10 oz bags.  Who measures?? Well, I didn't measure. I think if I had used maybe 1 1/2 to 2 bags it might of been okay.<br /><br />Okay, so I didn't react soy-wise, but.... what's the good of being rid of the reactive element if you get rid of the flavor and enjoyment at the same time?! I might as  well done plain cookies in that case! Or shortbread, then I wouldn't of expected chocolate-chip flavor, ya know?!?<br /><br />If you can find the ""right"" bag of Dagoba (Organic Chocolate) Chocodrops 73% cacao content, in the baking section, read the label [one bag HAD soy lecithin; the other one from another store didn't-of course I bought it, and they really didn't have the soy lecithin, how odd. April 2011], they are a much better choice, choco chip size-wise. The Dagoba's were an accident find. Unfortunately, these are only 8 oz. (not 12), but the flavor stands up to the baking. You probably want to add vanilla to complement. * I got mine from Whole Food's Market. This isn't something you typically find at Safeway or Lucky's Market, FYI.<br /><br />I will make it a point to re-bake using two bags and see what happens and add a comment"

One caveat: I make ""lattes"" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.

It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word ""English,"" which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday ""work horse,"" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee."

Shirley ""Laurie's Boomer Views""",3,3,5,1276387200,Confessions Of A Die-Hard Coffee Drinker,"Good Earth Green Tea - Lemongrass<br /><br />No way, no how, was I ever going to be a tea drinker. Coffee was my perker-upper of choice, and loved every jittery cup of it. I still like my morning cup and the aroma of good coffee brewing in the morning. Whenever offered tea by friends I'd always decline - ""coffee if you've got it please"". I would settle for the last of a pot that had been heating for hours rather then try tea. So to say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant, or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. So when I say I Love This Tea - you can be sure that's the truth as well.<br /><br />It started with a coupon. It was a bargain to pick some up at my local market, and thought well, maybe I should have some on hand for all those tea lovers I know. Hearing so much about the benefits of green tea, I picked out a box of it and put it up on a shelf. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on this Good Earth Lemongrass. This one I loved.It was the best I tried. So naturally my next stop was here at Amazon. And naturally I found this great deal.<br /><br />The taste is wonderful and so is the aroma. Light and citrusy, but slightly sweet - not what I thought ""lemongrass"" would be.I didn't need to add anything at all. It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffe per serving. It gives me a renewed and refreshed energy in the afternoons without any jitteryness.It also doesn't seem to be  dehydrating -as coffee can be.Not to mention the other health benefits. According to the box, this blend is rich in antioxidants. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />Ingredients: Green Tea,Lemongrass,Natural Flavors,Rose petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />As I said, Amazon has the best deal. I bought the six pack of 25 bag boxes-<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG"">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. One box comes out to be less then the 20 bag box sold at my market.<br /><br />Oh and on the tag of each bag(which are slit to sit on the edge of the cup) are some delightful and inspiring quotations or proverbs that may start you out with a smile. Here are a couple of them I'll leave this review with:<br /><br />""You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket""...John Adams<br /><br />""Flowers leave some of their fragrance in the hand that bestows them""...Chinese Proverb<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie"

It works, or else I've been taken by the psychology of it.  I first encountered it at the Sterling winery in California.  Since we were joining the ""club"", we got quasi-VIP treatment, which included a demo of this device on a newly opened bottle of wine (yes, the Sterling wine store had them for sale for $45).  Wine was poured into one glass from the bottle, and another through the Vinturi.  It clearly made a difference in aroma and taste.  We've since done a couple of blind tests, and picked the aerated wine every time.<br /><br />Now, let me save you a couple bucks.  The basic device includes a small rubber stand for storing the Vinturi.  It is just fine.  The upgraded 6-piece set includes a less-than-useful stand.  It is not attractive enough to leave on display, so it's another bulky thing to store.  Also, we found that our wine glasses were either too short--and we got spashing--or they were too tall and wouldn't fit.  Plus, the stand holds the Vinturi perfectly vertical, which is contrary to the included instructions, which tell you to tip it slightly to the side.<br /><br />So, fellow wine drinkers, get the $25.47 model, and you'll be quite pleased.  Don't waste your money on the six-piece version with the stand."

Guests are always impressed with its flavor as an iced tea, and in the South...iced tea rules!

We have only tried the Applewood Smoked Bacon but were extremely impressed.  The slices were thicker and smokier than the national brands. The smoke flavor was not bitter at all and very palatable. True to advertising, they shrank very little.  The finished texture was chewier rather than crisp, but we enjoyed that.  We topped our shrimp grits with the bacon and cheddar cheese and all were superb.<br /> Today we had hot sliced turkey sandwiches with two slices of the Applewood smoked bacon.  Absolutely delicious!

I had already figured out a means to cheaply combine my own flour ingredients so I wouldn't need to purchase the expensive Red Mill gluten free flour. Next, I located on Amazon a great bulk deal on bakers yeast that also added to cost reduction (and was superior in result too.) After buying this Xanthan gum, I further reduced the price per loaf significantly. I have found this product works well and have not noticed any difference in quality of my results with my bread. So, I am very happy to have found this alternative at a more reasonable price. I also like the zip lock bag it comes in which is much more handy for baking and easy handling than the Red Mill bag."

The incredible variety of the pack though nulls out the useless decaf in my opinion. We have been drinking the exact same k-cups for the last year so the variety is welcome."

The price is better than original nespresso's and they are ""greener"" but that is the end of the story for me since:<br /><br />1. Taste is for me only at minimum quality and therefore not comparable with the original nespresso capsules that I have tasted. Taste is of course different from person to person.<br /><br />2. I have a Citiz and when I put a capsule in the machine I have to press down the handle with a force that to me seems too much in relation to what is good for the machine. If you take one of these capsules appart you will see that just beneath the visible outer filter is a HARD plastic element, whereas the original nespresso capsules are only made of soft material. I guess this is why you have to press down the handle very hard. As you might have noticed the machine pops rectangular holes in the the capsule. I am affraid I will bend or break some plastic part in the machine.<br /><br />3. When the machine starts to ""shoot"" water through the capsule it hesitates for a second or two and then it says pop. During this second or two no coffee comes out, only water. After the pop coffee comes out instead. At the same time the flow of the coffee is VERY RANDOM, which means that every cup will be different from the other. There is even less coffee coming out of the machine because of the hesitation and the random flow, compared to an original nespresso capsule.<br /><br />In conclusion; with less coffee per capsule, random taste, and a questionable use of force to put the handle down, the lower price makes these cheaper capsules no longer attractive to me. One star is given for the green concept, but there is a limit of how much you want to sacrifice to go green. It should be noted, that all this could of course be because of my Citiz and how it is constructed compared to other Nespresso machine models."

I posted this review for the ""Natural Light"" variety, and it was originally on that page.  Now that the ""Natural Light"" was discontinued, they moved my review to this version where it doesn't apply.  However it is still true that the company which purchased Orville Redenbacher, ConAgra, no longer is making a less salty, 3.5oz/bag popcorn with unrefined palm oil.  This is a shame as no one else is either.  Despite what amazon.com has been doing, this is not an acceptable substitute for the other product and shouldn't be sent without permission to people who had the ""Natural Light"" on subscription delivery.  And after over a year of complaints, the bag size in the description should have been corrected.  Amazon.com, this is really shoddy behavior, and leads me to think it is a matter of mega-companies sticking together to scam customers out of our hard-earned cash.<br /><br />This review has been edited to reflect the mfr.'s change of the product.<br /><br />When I first reviewed this popcorn, I was describing the popcorn as it was in 2006.  It was made w/ very healthy unrefined palm oil containing nutritious beta-carotene and no trans fats.  It was also 3.5oz per bag.<br /><br />The mfr. has degraded the product.  It's now made w/ partially hydrogenated soy oil that has trans fat, and they've shrunk the bag to 2.9oz..  It's not any healthier or tastier than econo-brands now, but it is still much more expensive.  You also have to cook it for less time than is printed on the bag b/c of the smaller amount or it will burn.<br /><br />Whenever a good product is cheapened like this I always do an online search to see if the company was acquired, and sure enough, ConAgra bought Orville Redenbacher.  If you scan the reviews you'll see that almost all the 5-star reviews were written before 2007.  So don't bother complaining to the company about the decline in quality, b/c they don't care."

My son had opened and tasted it the first night; I didn't want it to go to waste, so I drank the bottle. And I slept very well that night, falling asleep within half an hour of drinking the Neuro Sleep and getting a solid eight or so hours sleep. Since it worked, I tried again the next night and that worked well, too. I then used it for a third night and woke up with my heart racing at about four in the morning and it took two or three hours to get back to sleep.<br /><br />I have a history of leg cramps. In the past, a friend had recommended I take a magnesium supplement to fend off the cramps and it had worked. But a few days after starting with the magnesium regimin, I started noticing that my heart would periodically start racing. It took me a couple of weeks - getting more and more concerned about a possible heart condition - before I connected it to the magnesium. I stopped taking the magnesium and within a few days the racing heart effect had disappeared. In the morning after my third night with Neuro Sleep, I looked into the ingredients and, sure enough, Neuro Sleep contains magnesium, to prevent muscle cramps.<br /><br />I won't take Neuro Sleep again, because I'm apparently sensitive to the magnesium in it. If you don't have a bad reaction to magnesium, though, this product may be for you.

Both basils shoot right out of their pods.  The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny.  The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding.  And this is at the beginning of week 2.  I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.<br /><br />The big question is, where is the Parsley?  People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano.  I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil.  I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil.  However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do.  Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.<br /><br />This is an easy, low maintenence kit.  You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.  It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets  They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box.

I know the days of penny candy are long gone but 22 cents per piece of candy is steep. Plus one of the 'candies' was actually a sizable quantity of cinnamon flavored toothpicks.  When is a toothpick considered candy?  If you count the individual toothpicks, then maybe you might hit 200 pieces (the toothpicks appear to number about 60 individual picks but they come in packages of 6 so, unless you're going to break open the package and dole them out one-at-a-time, you can't count that as 60 pieces of candy - especially when it doesn't even qualify as candy.)

Also I want to say that there is really nothing wrong with the mango hi-chew if you really really really love super ripe mangos.  Now I would say that I really do like mangos but not the super ripe mangos, I like it while it still has a little of a sour taste and the texture is more solid basically when it's sort of a yellow-orange color.<br /><br />If you love love super ripe mangos, where you wait for it to get really soft and it gets to that dark orange color and basically can eat it with a spoon because it melts in your mouth, than you will love this mango flavor because that's how the exactly captured it.  I'm not a big fan of that but my manager loves mangos like that, so I earned some big brownie points by giving him the rest of my mango hi-chew.  He really loved it, he ate the whole package (minus the one I ate) in about 2 days.

I was pleasantly surprised with the ditalini in the 250 gr box (9 ozs). I like this small pasta to put in soups and sides. It is a beautiful yellow color and tastes great. I was also very happy that it comes packaged in a bag within a box.  That means no chance of little critters getting inside the inner sealed package, love that. Most pastas out there do not have pastas in a secondary plastic insert and I've had to throw boxes out b/c I didn't get to eat them b/4 the critters did! The expiration date on these is also great--Sept of 2012 and it is only February of 2011 as I type this. On the ingredient label I do not see any listing for the fiber content which I like to know b/c I'm on WW; but that's a small negative.  This is made in Italy which seems to me a place that knows their pasta.  All in all, a good find and I will share it with friends, celiac and non-celiac alike."

I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!"

Like others I have used the $3 bottle of store bought balsamic vinegar. There is NO comparison.<br /><br />This stuff is thick and sweat. It has the viscosity of syrup. The flavors are rich and complex. This stuff adds an incredible eating experience when drizzled over a good cheese. It is delightful on Avacado. I originally used it on a juicy heirloom tomato and was disappointed because the juice of the tomato watered down the syrupy goodness of the vinegar too much. To experience this product you do not want to water it down in any way.<br /><br />I mixed 1/2 vinegar, 1/2 olive oil with some minced garlic and onions, a little salt and pepper. It made a nice thick dressing that was to die for spooned over mixed greens. Also, my concoction did not diminish the viscosity or the flavor of the vinegar in any way. When using this product you want the vinegar to always be at the center of the taste experience.<br /><br />The biggest negative for this product is that once you try it there is no going back. And, at $45 a bottle it is priced like liquid gold. Heck, I do not spend that much for a 1/5th of quality Bourbon! I find myself checking the level in the bottle every time I open the cabinet. This stuff is a real treat to be experienced.<br /><br />I am pretty frugal with how I spend my money. I never thought I would spend 45$ on a bottle of vinegar. But this is not vinegar as you and I traditionally know vinegar. Now, it is hard to imagine not having a bottle of this in our cupboard for those special occasions."

At my local grocery store 1 woody, dried out bean is $7.99! These beans arrived 2 days after I ordered them and the quality is amazing. All of the beans are 6-8 inches long, juicy, plump and full of seeds. They have oily skin (as vanilla beans should) and the aroma is divine. I made vanilla bean cupcakes and vanilla bean ice cream and started homemade extract(half of this pack, about 22 beans). These beans are perfect. I can't believe the quality for the price. If you are debating, go for it. You won't regret it!<br /><br />******UPDATE*******<br />I am still just as pleased with these beans as I was when I first got them. After 3 months of maturation, my homemade vanilla extract is excellent! Dark brown and slightly ""syrupy"" and it will only get better with age. Total price of the beans used in the extract (22 whole beans, split ~$10.00) and the alcohol (smirnoff vodka750 ml. ~$9.00) just under $20.00 produced an entire quart/32 ouces of fantastic extract and seeing as the ""pure"" vanilla extract in my grocery is about $6.00 per 2 oz. bottle the savings is tremendous. I would still be saving a fair amount if I purchased vanilla in bulk (like at Costco.) It is simply a win-win."

I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).  The only coffee I've ever had seemed terrible to me (then again, cheap crappy coffee probably really is terrible).  I wouldn't have normally ordered this, but the description sounded so nice and tasty that I decided to give it a try.  I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.  I liked it well enough that I'd even consider drinking it regularly along with my tea!  So, if any of this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and give it a try!"

The only reason that I don't feed this 100% of the time, is because just like with humans, you have to be a little concerned about the amount of mercury in fish.  Nothing to do specifically with this brand - they do everything right.  It's just not the healthiest thing in the world to feed nothing but tuna - the mercury levels can build up and that isn't good.

Boyle ""Book Lover""",0,0,2,1340582400,Need a LOT of doctoring,"I bought these noodle bowls based on other reviews and my (limited) previous experience with the brand.  As a quick, portable lunch these are good, although the noodle bowls are slightly less easy to deal with because you have to drain the noodles, and in doing so you lose some of the dried bits of the topping mix.  The soup bowls are great in that you keep the cooking liquid, which makes for fewer messes.  The soup bowls tend to be lower in calories, as well.<br /><br />That said, the first time I tasted one of these bowls I was disgusted.  With zero additions, the sauce is sweet, syrupy, and hugely reminiscent of soy sauce.  The next time I doctored it with a lot of sriracha sauce and it was better, but only slightly.  Still not edible.<br /><br />Today I tried something different that actually made it pleasant to eat.  I added about one-and-a-half tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter and a cup of leftover sauteed zucchini and onions.  The zucchini and onions add heft to the bowl, needed when the whole thing is just a big mess of sticky noodles.  The peanut butter took a while to stir into the sauce, but removed the overly sweet, syrupy taste.  I can even tell that there actually IS a bit of a spice kick to the sauce now.<br /><br />Of course, all that doctoring makes it much less simple to prepare, so I won't be buying this one again.  It's easier and cheaper for me to just make a batch of noodles and vegetables in peanut sauce and portion it into lunch-sized servings."

If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea.""  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea.""  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a ""traditional"" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.

They cheese can also stick to your hands. I actually like the taste of these more than the sour cream and onion Pop Chips I purchased in the same order.

With 4 teaspoons per cup, I can maybe manage about 10 cups. It has a much higher value if you simply mix a teaspoon or two to hot chocolate or coffee since I can still get the same flavor, but enhanced with the taste of coffee or more chocolate.

The first ""food"" we introduced was rice cereal as recommended by our pediatrician. We tried every day for 2 weeks to feed my son rice cereal and then oatmeal cereal but he hated both! He'd refuse the food by turning away and keeping his mouth tightly shut. I was at my wits end and gave him a break because I knew I had to be patient. I was never a huge fan of the idea of feeding my son rice cereal so I went searching for something that was convenient and came in small portions. I didn't want to feed my son the traditional baby food from a jar due to the risk of BPA found in the jar lids. Luckily, I found NurturMe! My son loved it from the start.  We started with the peas and then worked our way through the apple, squash, and sweet potato.<br /><br />Here is what I love about NuturMe Baby Food:<br /><br />CONVENIENCE. The food comes in BPA-FREE paper pouches that are easy to travel with. They contain the same amount of food as a 2.5oz jar of baby food. When we first started my son on solids he ate 1/2 pouch at each feeding. We saved the rest in the fridge and fed the the rest at his second feeding. It states on the packaging that they can last 2-3 days refrigerated. I personally only trust 24 hours if prepared with formula and 2-3 days if made with water. This is because it states on the formula can that prepared formula should be discarded after 24 hours. If I still breastfed, I would trust breastmilk to last 2-3 days as well.<br /><br />TASTE. Although the food is quick dried, it tastes fresh! The peas actually taste like peas and they are actually bright green, like they should be. I've tried the foods myself before I first fed them to my son and they passed my taste test! I also love that the baby food is organic. This is very important to me that everything my son eats is free of pesticides. I am conscious about what I eat, it shouldn't be any different for my son.<br /><br />MIX & MATCH. I love that you can mix and match the baby foods together to make new flavor profiles for the baby. I am all about introducing new foods to my baby and this is the perfect way to do it! Another great idea is to add juice to the baby food once your baby is 8+ months. When my son gets older I am going to try out adding pomegranate juice to the apple variety. I don't plan of giving my son juice to drink so this is a great way to introduce him to the flavor of pomegranate.<br /><br />ECO-FRIENDLY. The packaging to completely recyclable and doesn't take of the space that canned baby food does. That means a smaller carbon footprint! In addition, the packaging is BPA-FREE. I emailed the company and asked them before I purchased the product on Amazon.<br /><br />Here is the only issue I have with NurturMe:<br /><br />CONSISTENCY. I noticed that it can be difficult to mix the baby food together to get the desired consistency. For instance, the apple was really clumpy and hard before I added the water and I had a difficult time getting all of the clumps out. Its similar to mixing formula -- you have to take extra care! My remedy for this was to use a handheld milk frother and from then on I got the perfect consistency with no clumps! I've also noticed that the peas have a little bit of a grainy texture but my son doesn't seem to mind.<br /><br />I am definitely happy with NuturMe baby food. I think it is a quick and convenient way to serve my baby organic baby food for when we are on the go! It is the best alternative I have found to homemade baby food."

All my dogs are on grain-free dry food. So naturally I started him on dry food. Later on, I tried different wet food but he refused them.<br /><br />My cat is not an eager eater. He gets unlimited supply of dried food throughout the day, and he always finishes fixed amount which is in line with vet's recommendation. He also snacks on Pounce throughout the day, but mostly he prefers just to play. Play with his hyperactive adopted doggie siblings, his adopted human, or any newly discovered toys. He plays non-stop about 80% of his awake time. Food comes second in priority. That was all true, until he met the Friskies canned cat food months later.<br /><br />The first time my cat tried the Friskies savory shreds whitefish and tuna in sauce, he hestiated just like when he first encountered cheese, yogurt, or small chunks of steak. But unlike steaks or cheese which he simply left untouched nowadays, he took one lick of the Friskies shreded seafood and he gulbbed down whatever he could fit into his tiny tummy. Since then, he's fed a mix of dry and wet food. He still gets unlimited dried food through the day and only one meal of wet food at night (mixed with dry food). He's usually not very vocal and hardly talk. But when he sees his wet food coming in the special bowl, he would follow the bowl and sing all the way to his dinning area.<br /><br />Like all pet owners, I hope my cat would always eat a healthy and balanced diet. I also wish he would prefer some food that would smell more pleasing to human sense than his current favorite, this Friskies. But being such a good, well behaved, and healthy pet, I think he deserves something he likes so much. My cat has been on a mix of dry and wet food for a few months now. He's long and lean like a 10 pound tiger. And the vet is giving him a clean bill of health. One day he may grow tired of this, or gain enough weight for us to be alarmed. But as long as he stays healthy and fit and sings the Friskies' praises, this will remain his nighttime snack!"

They soften up quickly, unlike rawhide, yet can be enjoyed longer than a biscuit because of their consistency. My only caveat would be to watch the aggressive type eaters carefully, (especially large breeds), as they may try to wolf these down whole or barely damp only to end up gagging. Fortunately they usually gag right up. They also lack the corners of hard rawhide strips which saves the esophagus on the way down (and back up), should they try and swallow it whole. I think they are best for small and medium dogs who do not try this but rather attempt to gnaw, dampen and enjoy the treat more normally.<br />Overall, for healthy normal eaters, they are a nice treat and a good change of pace."

Most people I've talked to that bad mouth perked coffee have never even tasted perked coffee, that's a fact, they simply parrot the majority, christian's tend to follow the others like lost sheep the most.<br /><br />The water does not boil when you percolate coffee, as when using a glass percolator you can see the water percolating way before it starts to boil, also as the water travels up, the water very slightly cools.  What you have to do as soon as it starts to percolate is to monitor the heat. I shut the heat off of my electric stove, if you have gas, just lower the heat, and let it perk for about 2 min. or so. I will admit that you have to monitor the process, but it is so, so worth it.<br /><br />I will say that I don't cook with aluminum, and there's a very scientific reason for brewing coffee in an aluminum pot, but this is not the place to get into it.<br /><br />Grinding the beans to the best coarseness for percolating can sometimes be a pain, (well not that big of a pain), but still I thought I would try this coffee out.<br />Perfect, perfect coffee, at a perfect grind using the best method for brewing coffee and I have a winner."

He's adapting to life outside of the rescue home, and we're adapting the double-barreled threat of a high-energy breed and what can only be described as lingering puppy brain (in the full size body of a grown dog).<br /><br />There are toys for exuberant play (such as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD57ZI"">Kong Wubba</a>), and there are toys for quieter times, and to fully satisfy a dog's need to chew.<br /><br />First, the dog loves this chew. And when he engages with it, the result is an extended period of time when we does so in one place (very much unlike other toys, which generated motion and noise!).<br /><br />Second, it's odor and splinter free. We don't find pieces of it laying around, and it has no smell (at least to us two-legged critters).<br /><br />This was recommended to us by a local dog specialty store, and the research I've done indicates far fewer concerns about its safety compared with other chew options.<br /><br />Makes our dog happy and lets him turn down his motor a bit.

I remember well my first toothpick, ""Gabriel."" An admirable piece of wood, so graceful in the ways of dislodging food from between ones teeth, his dance like the effortless grace of a Darcey Bussell. Alas, I was but a child and misused Gabriel, splintering him on an unprincipled frog bone snagged between my first and second premolars. I will never forget Gabriel. On the someteenth anniversary of his removal of a very recalcitrant pomegranate seed I decided to peruse Amazon for a replacement. I was suprised at the results.<br /><br />This product advertises itself as ""low-in-fat, high-in-taste."" This is marvellous because I am on a diet. A good majority of us lack the digestive enzymes necessary to process wood. Although, my colleague Gareth Mitchell Headgraves is a rarity. I admit I become anxious when I leave himself alone in a room with a good piece of teak. In any case, despite a few misguided efforts, I cannot digest wood and will reaffirm that for most of us this product is low in fat.<br /><br />After trying this product I became intruiged by a fellow reviewer's suggestion to try making your own home brew cinammon sticks. His have been brewing for 29 years. This engorged my curiousity. What flavours could I impregnate a toothpick with? Could I try a sweet Canary wine? Or a supple juniper extract? Perhaps a melegueta pepper?<br /><br />3 stars because this product only opened up my curiousity for new toothpick flavours, and now find cinnamon to be lacking.<br /><br />PS - fortunately for the parsimonious among us, Amazon has this item listed as used."

276753,B000F41ZFA,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,C. Rocklein,5,5,3,1298764800,Murky.  Darjeeling or Ceylon a better bet.,"I wasn't very impressed with this tea, though I did manage to finish the tin.  People drink black tea (or 'red tea' as they call it in China) with milk and sugar typically, though I am happy to have some black tea without either prefering to enjoy the natural taste of the tea over the milk and sugar.  This Special Rare Assam from Taylors of Harrogate however, didn't really do it for me (either with milk or without).  It's worth noting that the flavor of a particular region's tea can vary between seasons.  A lot of sun in the fall tends to produce a 'sunnier' flavor with more subtly sweet aftertones, whereas a foggy rainy season before harvest tends to lend the tea a murkier flavor inclining towards bitterness especially when brewed strong.  That was my impression of this tea.  I've actually been to Assam which is only a day's travel from Darjeeling in the eastern Himalaya, and is at a considerably lower altitude.  Darjeeling is considered by most in those regions to be a superior tea, and all personal experience has led me to agree with this.  The only other Assam tea that I've had besides this product was some of the cheap powdered or ground black, which they commonly use to make chai - and which I bought while in Assam.  I found that to be a more refreshing cup even without the milk and spices, than this Taylors Special Rare (which I also drink without milk). Maybe it was just the season, but I honestly couldn't recommend this tea."

I never tried it before because I know a lot of people have an unpleasant reaction to it, such as a bitter or metallic taste. I'm happy to say it tastes great to me. It has the same ""buzz"" or ""bite"" as salt does, you don't need to use quite as much to get the same saltiness in foods as with Sodium-Chloride, and I experience no aftertaste or metallic/bitter flavor. It also seems to bring out accompanying flavors, such as garlic, just as well as real salt does.<br /><br />The only slight problem, and the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it doesn't have an after-taste but an ""after-effect"". I get a very slight feeling of tightness in my throat, like when you salivate before vomiting. It sounds a lot worse than it is, because it's a very mild effect. Salt actually does the same thing to the palate, but not as strongly as Potassium-Chloride does; for me, at least.<br /><br />Overall an excellent substitute for a more healthy lifestyle that just takes a little ""getting used to""."

Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me!

There are a few that have authentic taste but are just too weak overall, and unfortunately, Stash Double Spiced Chai falls into that category despite hitting all the right notes with the spices.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag for the first time, I was concerned that this would be overloaded with too much cinnamon, but from the green stains on the bag it was apparent that they stuck a load of cardamom in there as well, which is a good thing.  With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on."

The most aggresive growth is the mint.  Next it is neck & neck w/dill & chive.  I find myself cutting dill & chives to ""clear the shade"" in the hopes that the rest can catch up. I will say that I left a hydroponic tomatoe in the light of the machine...and in 2 weeks the fruit still looked fresh & the skin had visual bubbles or pimples in it.  When I opened the tomatoe nearly every seed had sprouted...yes SPROUTED within the tomatoe (so cool to see by the way - actual leaves inside a tomatoe!).  So I transplanted 4 seedlings into the empty basil ""herb pod"" and moved it to the back corner of the unit.  AeroGarden says the nutrients are different for herbs vs. vegetables...but if I can keep these sprots alive for another 4 weeks...I am in business with 4 REAL tomatoe plants.

You will get one rice mold (mine was pink instead of blue, as in the picture) and a package with 10 sheets of nori wrappers. The instructions for the wrappers are a little hard to follow, but after doing it twice it is relatively easy. I bought these so I could make an onigiri in the morning, toss it in my bag and have it for lunch at work. I'm not confident enough in my wrapping skills to throw the onigiri in my bag quite yet, but I will get there.<br /><br />These sheets of nori are packaged individually between one sheet of shiny plastic and one sheet of non-stick plastic. They are air-tight. This makes the nori unbelievably fresh. In addition, the nori itself is thinner than the nori I usually use, which allows the nori to stay stuck to the rice (thicker sheets tend to unpeel themselves), and makes it easier to bite into. In short, they are designed especially for onigiri.<br /><br />... but the really special thing about these wrappers is the layer of nonstick plastic between the rice and the nori. When you peel away the wrapper, the rice and nori meet for the first time. When I bit into the first onigiri I made from this set, I was absolutely blown away. Never have I had nori so fresh. Texturally, it's a totally different experience. Instead of chewy or soggy, the nori is dry and crunchy. It breaks apart easily. If you have had sushi before, you know that the seaweed wrapped around the outside is kind of chewy and impossible to bite in half. This seaweed is exactly the opposite because it doesn't absorb any moisture from the air or the rice until the moment you're ready to eat it.<br /><br />I know that these sheets are used all over Japan to package convenience store onigiri. Because they are made especially for onigiri, they are especially good. I will be repurchasing more wrappers in the future. They are really wonderful!"

The AeroGarden uses as much electricity as a 60-watt bulb.  A 60-watt bulb running 17 hours a day for 31 days a month will only use approximately 32 kwh of electricity.  Even if you live in an area with a higher than average rate (say 11 cents), that will cost you a mere $3.50 to run.  Split the difference (it runs on the herb mode for 4 hours without lights) and say it's running full power for 19 hours... that's $3.90.  If you can't afford an extra 4 bucks in electricity a month, why are you buying a $150 kitchen toy?? Check your facts before posting your reviews, people!<br /><br />This is a fun item to use to grow your own lettuce, herbs, tomatoes, peppers, and yes, even flowers! in your own home.  It doesn't take too much upkeep and it doesn't suck all that much power.

It is a ""session coffee"" - the kind that you can enjoy, and then not worry if you want to have a second cup.<br /><br />The challenge for this kind of coffee is that it doesn't become bitter if you put too much in your filter. I made this with a Melitta filter, in a Melitta maker. I'm satisfied. There is a strong finish to this coffee, but even at a higher strength, it won't overshoot.<br /><br />I used to work in a fine hotel restaurant. We served a rich but mellow cup.

This is a cup that you would serve to guests without reservation.<br /><br />I drink coffee with a blend of half-and-half and 2 percent milk, and often with a bit of sugar.

Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It is commercially manufactured from ""xylan hemicellulose"" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This ""NOW"" Xylitol is actually made from a corn source.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates.<br /><br />Each teaspoon contains:<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Sugar Alcohol 4g<br />Sodium 0mg<br />Protein 0g<br /><br />""Now"" Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes.<br /><br />When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea. It only seems to contain .45 grams of Sugar Alcohol per packet. Both are great sweet alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />If you are tired of the aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners, give these products a try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

In our quest to find him a food that was good for him and he actually liked eating I stumbled on Taste of the Wild at a local specialty dog food store. I decided to give TotW a chance after trying Canidae and realizing that the protein content was too high for my Frenchie.<br /><br />After switching to Taste of the Wild I immediately noticed an improvement in my pups stool - nice and firm and only 2-3 movements per day. Vice 5+ movements on Nutro and Canidae. My Frenchie's notorious gas was also cut way down. I supplement his dog food with all-natural unflavored yogurt too and this helps cut down on the gas greatly. After a few weeks I also noted that my dog's coat is soft and shines.<br /><br />Another positive to Taste of the Wild is that their formulas are similar enough between Hi Prairie, Pacific Stream and Wetlands Canine that I can rotate the menu a bit and keep my pup happily chomping down on his food. Previously my dog would tire of the same dog food after only a few weeks.<br /><br />For anyone with a dog with food allergies I highly recommend Taste of the Wild.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

She's a picky eater, so when I opened the first can and she started yowling ""Give it to me NOW"" like Veruca Salt, I figured I had a winner. The vet we had at the time - hereafter known as Old Vet - didn't see anything wrong with it, so Weruva became her diet.<br /><br />Kitty, who has always been a pudgy little picture of health, started losing weight last year. Old Vet was not concerned at first and certainly did not attribute her weight loss to her food. However, when it progressed from half a poiund, to one, to more than three, a battery of tests was clearly in order.  At that point (July) Kitty was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid and kidney disease. Frequent visits to Old Vet for diagnosis and treatment began... lots of fun, as you can imagine. Food was again not deemed to be a problem.<br /><br />A month ago Kitty started having continual problems with her bowels and developed a raging kidney infection. Old Vet put her on an antibiotic. Symptoms worsened. She appeared to be in rapid decline and was thoroughly miserable. The antibiotic only made a slight difference, and Old Vet wasn't giving us helpful answers, so we went to see New Vet. New Vet ordered more blood work (fourth draw of the year - oh boy).  When New Vet got the results, she immediately prescribed another course of antibiotics, and a new prescription diet.<br /><br />Whoda thunk? It's been one week, and hallelujah! Kitty's recovery has been drastic. I feel like we dodged a bullet... and now I have 40 cans of Weruva to get rid of. I can't prove that Weruva is the culprit for my cat's health problems, and I absolve neither Old Vet nor myself for missing the connection to baby's diet.

Donahue iii,2,2,5,1316390400,Why Didn't Someone Think Of This Sooner?,"Empty K-Cups, miniature filters and lids allow you to use your own favorite ground coffee.  If you buy roasted beans and grind your own, this is the solution for you.  One scoop in the K-Cup, put on the lid and pop it into your Kuerig.<br /><br />I shied away from buying a Kuerig because I love my Kenya-AA from Talk 'n Coffee in Deptford, NJ.  They roast it dark, grind it almost to percolator coarseness for me (sigh) and ship it to me here in Florida.  I had tried mesh filters but even with my custom percolator grind, I'd get grinds in the brew.  The special cup holders looked like a labor-intensive solution too so I stuck with my Mr. Coffee.  When I saw the disposable cups on Amazon, I ordered them along with the Keurig.<br /><br />This works great!  A single fresh hot cup of Kenyaa AA dark roast whenever the spirit moves me and no worries about having to make a partial pot for only one cup.  I'll have Talk 'n Coffee grind the beans a little finer for the Kuerig on my next order.  I re-ground my percolator grind a little finer and the portion strength is now perfect for the travel mug size.<br /><br />Kathy buys loose tea and uses the disposable K-Cup for a mug whenever it suits her fancy.  It's a lot easier than the little metal thingie with the chain and waiting for a kettle to boil.<br /><br />One benefit I hadn't counted on is that clean-up is easy and fast - pluck the used disposable K-Cup from the Kuerig and toss it in the trash.  No more having to service the coffee pot!<br /><br />To save time in the morning, I used to set up Mr. Coffee the night before but now I just make up the disposable K-Cups a dozen at a time and we fresh-brew by the cup in the morning for several days running. We actually use less coffee after evaporation and ""who doesn't want the last cup"" considerations.  I think the savings on coffee and Mr. Coffee filters is probably break-even with the cost of the disposable K-Cups so net-net, they seem free.<br /><br />Only one con from me.  It's hard for these arthritic old hands to fit the lid on due to the filter overlapping the top of the K-Cup.  Folding or cutting away the overlap causes grinds in the brew and a clogged lower needle.  I don't think there is a cure without the downside being greater than the problem.  I have found patience and not over loading the K-Cup to be the best solution."

And the crema produced is a dream - though the fancy, much older, espresso machine at work can't hope to achieve this with me driving it --- the DeLonghi is just newbie-proof and brews this blend really really nicely.<br /><br />Though she was initially disappointed I didn't splurge on the illy to christen the new machine, she likes the lattes we're making at home more than her $3 coffee shop favorite. This blend is fine for my mocha, too, though if she didn't LOVE this coffee I'd give the Rossa a whirl looking for just a little stronger flavor to stand up with the cocca powder. Frankly - this is making as good a mocha as what I buy at any of my 3 shops, so I'm happy too!<br /><br />Glad I trusted the reviews. I just signed up for a ""subscription"" - can't beat the price!"

Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me!

This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.

The first time she used it, she was frustrated and confused, and my mom just gave her the food inside after a while. The second time, I was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn't touch the toy. She got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts. She eventually discovered a way of manipulating it (tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck) that was most successful. The kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time, which was happening often before. The third time, I barely watched her, and she had the food out pretty quickly. She started to get really frustrated with the toy, wanting more kibble to come out. I examined the toy, and there wasn't a single kibble left! This surprised me that she was so quick, but a similar thing happened when I introduced her to the Kong. It was quite hard the first time; but, after that, she seemed to have easy success."

Peppermint cookies - no way. But, yes they work. I wanted something to look forward to but not crumbly or flaky. Once you learn not to pig out and eat slowly and prudently your focus turns to flavor and the baker's sugar stays on the cookie where it belongs.<br /><br />Took these cookies to the office suite which is full of Marin County foodies and supercilious gourmet snobs. First thing I said was ""you can't have any because they were made in Mississippi and you loathe anything of or about the South"". To them, if its not cooked in New York City or San Francisco any possibility of these being gourmet cookies is an oxymoron. That is until they saw the UPS guy who is also a very well known caterer wolf two key lime snaps down. Recklessly tossing their political correctness and self esteem aside, the resident food fascist requested a taste which was granted despite the fact some personal injury lawyers were mixed among them.<br /><br />Doling out the Flathau's snaps for a week while emphasizing their Southern orgin was a treat in addition to the snaps. Several geographical gourmets are in recovery from the fact that something of culinary greatness came from Mississippi. Then again, ignorance is its own reward.<br /><br />These cookies are a real ""pick me up"" and are delicious. When dining out while traveling I will eat one for dessert and present one to the server who usually raves about the taste. Its a good way to stay on a diet and to make friends, especially with servers who are in a position to return the favor."

These ole school favorites are advertised by this seller (DAB Unlimited) as described of which is very important to me as an online consumer. The picture displayed is what I exactly received.

As you have probably read before purchasing, some customers received other flavors including Pomegranate, Green Apple, & Banana. This can't be controlled as these are new added sixth flavors but, you are highly likely to receive substantial amounts of at least 4 of the original 5 flavors out of 6 total flavors in your box. My box was sealed and unopened so I know that the vendor doesn't have any control over that and I'm sure that Hershey will have a nice song and dance for you too if you called. At least with calling Hershey you might get a coupon sent to your home. Enjoy."

Even with just olive oil and fresh parmesan it was just plain to me and all the cheese ended up on the bottom of the bowl because it didn't stick to the slippery noodles.

By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good...

Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.

I've always liked tea, but only recently have I become completely obsessed. Within the last 6 months I've begun to accumulate all kinds of tea. Within that time period this tea has quickly made its way into my favorites and I'll definitely be repurchasing when I run out.<br /><br />I love this stuff. No, I mean I LOVE it. Seriously. While it isn't actually tea at all, it's prepared the same way - add the 'leaves', steep, add preferred additives, drink, YUM. There is no actual tea in this product, it's all cocoa bean shells. Because of this, you have to like the natural, earthy cocoa flavor (like that of dark, dark, dark organic chocolate you might find in a health food store) to like this tea. If you're expecting it to taste like a candy bar or cake you'll be disappointed. While it DOES smell like candy, it simply does not taste that way. (However, I suppose you could add an absurd amount of sweetener to give it a candy taste but that really counteracts a lot of the health benefits of this tea. It also takes away from it's natural taste which is amazing!)<br /><br />The thing that caught my eye about this tea initially was the flavor, of course. What made me really decide to make the purchase was all of the claims. The description says it has vitamin D and iron - which is especially good for someone like me who is both anemic and vitamin D deficient who could use as much of that in their daily intake as they can get- and it also claims to have natural serotonin raising capabilities due to the fact it's pure cocoa, which as most people know, is good for you and full of feel-good elements.<br /><br />While I can't prove or disprove any of those things, I will say this tea is delicious and worth the somewhat hefty price. You get a lot of bang for you buck and unless it's your staple tea you drink every day, several times a day it should last you quite a while.<br /><br />I'd like to note that the tea-to-water ratio recommended on the container might be a little exaggerated. I use a little over half the recommended tea to go with the amount of water I'm using, and it does just fine. It doesn't taste watery or weak at all. And unlike most teas, you can let this steep while you're drinking it and there's no gross, over steeped taste. I've also found you can also re-steep the tea 2-3 times before any substantial loss in flavor. Knowing that that, it can more than double the cups of tea you get per tin.<br /><br />Anyway, the main point is I really like this tea and recommend it."

An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them).

Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past."

He's also been a fan of Legos since childhood.  I ordered a pound and hoped for the best.  The pieces are standard two by one pegs, two by twos, and two by threes.  Very few even showed mild chips, and all snap together for building.<br /><br />There are four flavors in the box:  Blue raspberry, green apple, cherry, and banana.  The flavors are on par with Sweet Tarts, as someone else mentioned.  Unfortunately, the banana kind of perfumes all the other blocks, so if you're really not into banana, this may not be the best candy.  Surprisingly, these are not excessively gritty like many Sweet Tart knockoffs.<br /><br />In this size bag, there's just enough for two people to play with and enjoy over a week. If you had a couple children, I'd recommend buying Ziplocs and dividing them that way.  A pound of this candy is roughly a filled quart-sized bag.<br /><br />Nutritionally, of course, the only thing this candy really has going for it is the fact is that it's low fat, which was one of the reasons I purchased it.  The chalky texture also insures you're not going to let it lie against your teeth to rot like a slicker, harder lollipop.<br /><br />I would absolutely buy this product again, though in this case for a child who has everything and whose mother doesn't want to have to put away another toy. ;)"

I use it as a quick pick me up. I have never had any issue and they taste great. I got French Roast one time because the Cyclone was sold out.

218547,B000UPNK9S,AY5PW8YSIG1VA,Ross Simons,11,11,5,1310947200,So happy right now,"Isn't it odd the weight and power that one bad review can have?<br /><br />I LOVE Thai Iced Tea but the nearest place was a thai restaurant I would have to order a meal from in order to get the tea. Even then, the allure of the tea would draw me to order somewhat mediocre food. Suffice it to say, I was looking for a way to make it on my own.<br /><br />I came across this tea (and various other brands) and it was looking promising except that one bad review relating to Green Tea. I second-guessed a potential purchase so much because of that one review.<br /><br />Finally I took the plunge and I couldn't be happier. It tastes exactly like it does from the various sources i've tried it from. Maybe Thai Iced Tea isn't supposed to have green tea, I'm not sure. I don't position myself on internet forums as an expert in tea. I DO know however that if it looks like thai iced tea, it smells like thai iced tea, and it tastes like thai iced tea, then for all intents and purposes it IS thai iced tea. Besides, green tea leaves are probably better for you anyways.<br /><br />Don't let this one negative review turn you off like it almost did to me.<br /><br />Now on to other matters:<br /><br />The quantity the package calls for is really too much. I make the tea in 64 oz. quantities and it only takes 4 tbsp. or so. I boil the water with the tea inside until it reaches a rolling boil, then I allow it to steep for 4-5 minutes. I was using the stainless steel muslin filter another reviewer mentioned, but unfortunately it was getting really groady looking and it was hard to dry as a college student. I've now invested in T-Sac tea filters, size #3.<br /><br />There is some ""dustiness"" to the tea. When I first started drinking it, I never noticed it until I got to the last 4-5 oz. or so in the pitcher since the dust sinks to the bottom. Now when i transfer the tea to the pitcher I just dont pour the last few oz. into the pitcher which effectively gets rid of any issues with tea dust.<br /><br />I mix the tea with milk and/or coffee creamer (original non-fat works splendidly) though i always use coffee creamer if I have it on hand.<br /><br />There is ONE problem. If you really liked thai iced tea before, there's a chance you're going to get addicted to it. I have a reusable 24 oz. iced drink tumbler and it's easy to fill that up a couple of times a day or more if drank with meals. with 2.5 of these cups you're looking at 64 oz. of thai iced tea a day if you're not careful. With that being said i'd much rather drink 40-50 oz. of thai iced tea than the 30-60 oz. of iced coffee with (regular i.e. with fat) cream, sugar, and caramel flavoring.<br /><br />It's a great alternative to coffee and I couldn't be happier."

As long as you're switching to a ""Limited Ingredient Diet"" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for ""chicken fat"" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />The Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion.

141588,B0015Z2KIY,A1F7SX3GNVBNE3,"Joshua G. Feldman ""Technophile""",24,24,5,1241136000,Awesome quality cacao nibs - powerful and satisfying.,"I'm a certified chocoholic with a weight problem.  I had heard that cacao nibs had all the health benefits of dark chocolate (way more, actually) without the sugar and junk food aspects.  They are loaded with antioxidants and have those powerful endorphin releasing stimulants.  They are also quite high in fiber (but also in saturated fats).<br /><br />I got my big pile of Navitas Naturals nibs and dug right in.  Well - these are a bit of an acquired taste; but once acquired, they really satisfy.  Cacao nibs are broken pieces of raw whole cacao beans that have been dried (and that's it).  They are brown, with a dark cocoa smell, and a seductive texture that's partly like a coffee bean (crunchy and hard), and partly like a piece of chocolate (buttery with a crisp and then melting fat).  The flavor initially gives you a cocoa hit and then a winey fermented flavor that is hard to describe.  The aftertaste is bitter like baking chocolate.  Like a coffee bean, there's some fibrous grit with the aftertaste after the creamy fats have dissolved on your tongue.  My first impressions was ""phew - that's disgusting"".  The winey flavor was off-putting and the bitterness in the aftertaste was hard to take.  That didn't prevent me from immediately having more, however - as the crisp rich creamy quality made me want more.  After a few pinches (maybe 3/4s of a tablespoon) I was flying!  I mean, these things are POTENT.  They really are loaded with all those endorphin releasing stimulants - and man they wake you up and then make you feel loved.  Over the next few days I kept a big baggie of these in my pack and ate them whenever I wanted a cup of coffee.  The stimulant effect is totally as strong as coffee - and more.  To go with the speed, there's a feeling of well being and intellectual stimulation that's seductive in the extreme.  I began to almost enjoy the odd powerful flavor.  My only concerns at this point are whether these are addictive!  About 1/2 way through my bag I have yet to hit a stem or a stone or an inedible piece (unlike what I've heard with some other brands).  The flavor and texture is pretty consistent as I work my way through too - pretty good for a totally raw organic product.<br /><br />I found that I could grind them up into powder in the blender and use the powder to ""cocoa"" up various foods (especially ones bearing some sweetness).  For example, after my workout I'd put a tablespoon of nibs and a tablespoon of chia seeds in the blender and grind nice and fine and then toss in a fist full of frozen blueberries, a glug of Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate sauce, 8 oz water and two scoops of whey protein powder (chocolate flavor, of course) and then blend.  It all whips up into a rich chocolatey blueberry shake that packs the nutritional wallop of a steak dinner with omega 3 oils, TONS of antioxidants, and a wicked emotional and blood sugar pick-me-up.  You can buy the powder pre-ground, but I imagine the goodies keep better in this coarsely cracked version.<br /><br />All in all - I think of cacao nibs as much as a drug like coffee as I do a food.  People who eat ultra-dark chocolate for the health aspects should absolutely check nibs out because my body tells me they have WAY MORE of the chemical goodies of chocolate with far less sugar and fat.  They also are brimming with a rich raw cocoa flavor that's weird and wonderful and hard to describe.  If you are bent in this way - this stuff is wonderful."

They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal."

I get terrible migraines and after lots of food logging I have found that beverages with aspartame are a migraine trigger.  I hate coffee and it is not uncommon for me to be swigging a caffeinated beverage at 9 a.m.  So, I wanted to try an alternative to an aspartame laden diet beverage.<br /><br />I have consumed my six cans and the diet cola needs more carbonation and an added ingredient, perhaps vanilla, to round out the flavor profile.  Each of my cans tasted flat.  There was no fizz and no crispness that one would typically associate with a diet Coke or Pepsi.  The flavor was just lacking and I wanted more of a kick on the end.<br /><br />Would I drink it again?  I'm not giving up on Zevia.  I will likely try one of the diet flavored beverages.  I experienced no headaches after drinking this beverage and that is a plus.  Additionally, for a beverage that uses stevia, I didn't experience an awful aftertaste.  Stevia is a sweetener that needs to be applied in specific amounts to avoid a strange aftertaste.  I think it is just a matter of finding the right flavor of Zevia."

176515,B004748SUY,AB4VS6GN4N8K6,Larry Anders,1,2,2,1340928000,Hoping to start a less biased discussion,"Immediately after drinking Penta, I definitely felt ""refreshed"" (whatever that means), the texture seems ""smoother"" and the water appears clearer, but I believe that these characteristics are merely psychosomatic and fall in line with thinking of what pure water means. I felt calmer overall, but I attribute this to the water, not the oxygen. Otherwise, I think the oxygen takes away from the full benefit of the product.<br /><br />After a few cycles of testing Penta, my instincts kicked in and I started reading about the effects of too much oxygen in the body and brain. Since it stands to reason that if Penta is infusing their bottles with oxygen, their water would end up being impregnated with it. Though the oxygen in their bottles could be minimal, it could be enough to offset the nitrogen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood after drinking enough of it, especially with their patented level of filtration. There's no doubt that Penta water feels like it is being absorbed more readily than others, an effect which seems enhanced when drinking it cold. I have noticed this effect also when I had a bout of altitude sickness in Colorado. At the time, someone recommended I drink plenty of water to feel better as it had oxygen in it. I found some bottled water (from another commercial brand) and drank as much as I could. I could literally feel the water oxygenate my body as I drank it.<br /><br />Logically, then, one might assume that water impregnated with oxygen would be better for you. I believe, though, that the benefits of oxygen in water are only met if the oxygen is within natural levels. Penta claims they add oxygen only to tighten the bottle. I'm sure their marketing team knew that people would come to their own conclusions about this statement and may assume that this was yet be another ""purifying"" aspect of Penta water. I know of no other drink manufacturer adding oxygen just to tighten their bottle, so I doubt there is a real concern about its use for packing purposes. For some of you who drink several bottles of Penta a day, you may want to consider how much you are over-saturating your blood with oxygen.<br /><br />I started doing some research on Penta with a much more critical eye. That is when I found James Randi. Mr. Randi, as some of you know, is a hyperbolic debunker and skeptic who has offered a one-million-dollar prize to anyone ""who can show under proper observing conditions, evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event."" After reading the letters (*which can be read publicly online) exchanged between Mr. Randi and the owner of Penta, I got the impression that the owner was just another health trend exploiter, not some arbiter of a new scientific frontier. The guy can't even spell. My thoughts are that this person stumbled upon the next trend of water purification and made a business decision to add a little something extra to merit a higher price point that would reap a greater profit than a competitor's brand. Don't get me wrong. I believe that deionized, low pH, metals -and -trace pharma free water is legit, but claims that Penta water is somehow more special than others using the same methods are truly unmitigated.<br /><br />I think people who are health-conscious these days are toeing the line between reasonable skepticism and hopeful hypochondriacs. I wanted to believe, like many people these days, that I could use an inexpensive regimen of pure supplements to undo any damage I've done to my body. I imagine that people think that when something like water, a necessary ingredient for sustaining human life, is hard to come by in an unadulterated state, it somehow means that ingesting great amounts of pure water must act as some sort of great equalizer in the body, that if you drink clean water, you are aiding your body in being able to reverse and repair damage.<br /><br />I'm sure some of you think my impressions of Penta are crackpot science at best, but consider how it is no different than staring at a few pdfs on the manufacturer's site, understanding none of it, and yet still believing a doctor claiming better benefits who was likely funded by Penta themselves to do the research. This method of boosting the appearance of legitimacy for purified water is common. Look up ""Ilumati Lithia water."" It appears they had involvement with a clinical trial from the University of British Columbia, a study that has been suspended due to ""logistical issues."" It's not that as a given I don't believe in the truthfulness of clinical trials. I just won't fall prey to believing that a product is better simply because it was involved in a clinical trial, especially if the product developer has anything to do with it. Think of how you yourself may be buying into quackery just by taking what a business driven for profit says at face value.<br /><br />I urge you to take stock of your own body and share what you've realistically experienced with Penta. I still believe pure water is extremely helpful for the body's regulation. Though this is not a cure-all, based on the competition out there, I believe this could be the best water on the market - if oxygen wasn't placed in the bottle as ""added value."""

I'm writing a review to let potential buyers know of its alternative use!<br /><br />When I moved into my new home about 6 months ago my husband and I were disappointed to find that the kitchen sink was badly stained.  It was made of white porcelain and appeared as though someone had poured blue ink or dye down the drain.  It coated the sides and pooled at the bottom and left a ring around the drain.  It was quite unsightly.  For the first month we tried several cleaners, including bleach, peroxide, magic erasers, comet, goo gone, paint thinner, ammonia, CLR, and tile cleaners.  We planned on replacing the sink entirely, mostly due to the chips on its surface and our preference for stainless steel, but the blue stain did play a part.<br /><br />As if by magic the solution came to us.  One afternoon I discovered that a bottle of MIO in my pantry was leaking.  I removed the bottle and placed it in the sink til I could check to see where the problem was coming from.  I cleaned up the mess on the shelf with little problems, amazed that a concentrate like that didn't stain the shelving!  When I returned to the sink and lifted the busted bottle I discovered that an oval MIO shape had been formed in the blue stain.  It was like applying a Crest white strip to my sink!  I then began to pour the concentrate all over the sink.  No scrubbing, no pain, no effort.  I simply turned on my faucet and watch MIO strip away the blue ink that had plagued me for 3 months as I rinsed it down the drain.  I contemplated how or why this worked.  Citric Acid? Malic Acid? Propylene Glycol?  Which chemical was to blame for its magical dye stripping properties?<br /><br />Beats me!  But to be honest.. I certainly don't want to drink it any more.  It can bleach porcelain better than.. well bleach.  So why on earth would I put it in my body?<br /><br />Hope this saves you from chemical cleaning of your digestive tract, or if you need a great spot remover... give it a whirl."

Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% ""steviocides"" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, ""The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook"".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This ""NOW"" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. ""Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz."" is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. ""Swanson"" and ""Nature's Way"" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"

A sugar alcohol that is:<br /><br />* Nearly half the calories of sugar<br /><br />* Prevents tooth decay<br /><br />* 100% natural<br /><br />* Tastes almost exactly like sugar<br /><br />Sweet-X Xylitol in granular form can be used just like ordinary table sugar at a ratio of 1:1. Like sugar, it is all natural, and has a great taste. It is about as sweet as table sugar, but has 40% less calories. When eaten plain it has a unique slippery bead like texture with a cool, almost mint-like quality; while table sugar has a hasher granular texture with a warmer, heavier quality. When dissolved in food, its slippery texture and cooling effect is not noticed, and so it is difficult to tell it apart from table sugar.<br /><br />Unlike table sugar, xylitol actually prevents tooth decay. Many microorganisms cannot digest xylitol. Xylitol is proven to be the best tooth decay fighting sweetener available.<br /><br />Unlike normal table sugar, xylitol cannot be used to bake yeast based breads because the yeast used cannot digest xylitol.<br /><br />Xylitol tastes great mixed with other high intensity sweeteners such as stevia (SoooLite!, SweetLeaf, etc.). I use it with equal portions of all nature SoooLite to make a great tasting low calorie natural sugar substitute that tastes almost exactly like sugar. It is a great mixture.<br /><br />Xylitol is all natural and safe. In 1963 xylitol was approved by the FDA for use in food production in the US. Xylitol exists naturally in the human body. The human body actually makes up to 15 grams of xylitol a day. Xylitol has a mild laxative quality in some people when high amounts are ingested. This usually subsides once the body adjusts to using it.<br /><br />Please do not give xylitol to dogs. Although safe for humans, dogs can develop a life threatening reaction to even small amounts of xylitol."

People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it (""they've been eating Wellness for years!""), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation."

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

I bought the whey through Amazon because it was a couple bucks cheaper than the retail price. I hoped to use it as a replacement to bodybuilding whey protein supplements that have a bunch of other ingredients - glucosamine, creatine, sugars, etc. I give big points to Red Mill for being simple and pure, and it's important to note they are selling a base whey protein concentrate, not a protein shake mix. It dissolves relatively well into water but not as well as leading protein drinks. The taste is what's sticking in my craw - it has a very raw, difficult to overcome flavor. It's like swallowing thin wallpaper paste (consistency) that has a strong, flat taste of the milky liquid that forms in cottage cheese containers. If you're planning to mix recipes like other reviewers recommend (adding apple juice, or spinach(?), or bananas and other fruit), you'll be fine. But be aware this is not drinkable on it's own - it requires strong flavors blended with it. I'm using it in my steel cut oatmeal in mornings, and I'll cook with it, but it looks like I'll need to stick with flavored protein shakes for meal supplementation."

There were only a few lavender flowers in the bag but they lent the tea a pronounced lavender flavor and mild lavender scent at the expense of the bergamot, which I had trouble detecting either by smell or taste.<br /><br />Now, I am a big fan of both lavender as a scent and Early Grey tea as a beverage but I don't generally appreciate floral flavorings.  Rose water taffy or rice pudding, lavender risotto, candied violets, anything of that sort always reminds me of soap, and not in a pleasant way.  Even vanilla is not a favorite, although I do enjoy hibiscus.<br /><br />However, the acidity of the tea balances out the floral qualities and after the first few sips, I began to enjoy the flavor and then was able pick up on the lavender scent when sipping.

Anyways if you are looking for real red tea leafs this<br />isn't the one your looking for probably, but for something worth only $25 I truly didn't expect the real version.<br />The Chai gave me stomachaches, which might be the herbs fault but it might just be me and the tea.<br />The Earl Gray is probably the only one that didn't have a great issue, but it might be me missing it.<br />The English Breakfast is probably the most questionable of the teas, since it has the effects of the fake red tea.<br />The Organic Lemon Black is a mix of English breakfast and a herb, which can probably coat the effects of the fake red tea.<br />Though the Lemon Black also gave me weird issues after drinking it, but wasn't as terrible as the Chai.<br />The Chai also seems to be a mix of the English Breakfast with some herb, so yea.<br />The Earl Gray is said on their paper to use the same tea leave, so I'm not sure is it really the same.<br />All 4 of the tea leaves are said by their handout to use the exact same tea leaf, so it might be a sale of fake tea.<br />I don't think anyone actually knows much about fake tea, but this is probably one of them.<br />Side note usually the real version cost well over 70 dollars, so its totally expected that something that cost only $25 isn't<br />that great."

It is now my favorite of coffees to buy. I make it in my Espresso machine; but I have also enjoyed it by the drip coffee method. I actually like it best by drip; but it is easier to use the Gaggia Espresso machine with the burr grinder. I like to drink this coffee with soy milk vanilla flavored and sweeten it and then it tastes like Chocolate is in there with the coffee. I do drink it black as espresso most often though. It is great that it is so smooth even when made concentrated. It is an organic medium roast. The best of the Chiapas coffee beans do have this naturally occurring chocolate molecule fragrance and flavor in the beans.

The powder does dissolve completely, leaving no residue after mixing and drinking.<br /><br />The drink itself tastes like Tang (which is not necessarily a good thing) with a slight artificial sweetener aftertaste (which is definitely not a good thing). I got about the same ""boost"" from this as I did from drinking Tang, which is to say, ""not much.""<br /><br />If you need a ""health boost"" save your money and buy a bottle of multi vitamins.

I tried Motherlove More Milk Two Alcohol Free because Motherlove was recommended for increasing breastmilk supply in a pamphlet I got from my lactation consultant.  It didn't work for me.  So then I tried More Milk Plus Alcohol Free.  That also didn't work for me.  Finally after talking to a couple of people, they recommended Fenugreek, which I had read about before, but wanted to give Motherlove's More Milk product line a try because of all the great reviews I read.  I ordered Motherlove's Fenugreek, and finally my breastmilk supply started to go up.<br /><br />Before Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours on average and getting about 3 ounces total (1 to 1.5 oz on left side and 1.5 to 2 oz on right side).  By the time I finished a 4 oz bottle of Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was still pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours but getting 4 to 5 oz total (up to 2 oz on left side and 2 to 3 oz on right side).<br /><br />I was worried about keeping up with my baby, but now my baby can't keep up with me.  After using Fenugreek for about a month, I'll have about 2 dozen 4 oz bottles of unfrozen milk in the fridge on any given day and I now have almost 80 frozen 5oz bottles in the freezer, and running out of room to store any more!<br /><br />Note: Although your supply increases, it does eventually plateau.  After finishing the Motherlove's Fenugreek, I switched to Nature's Way Fenugreek capsules because they're a fraction of the price, and you can take them with meals.  Motherlove recommends you avoid water 20 minutes before and after taking their product.  The Nature's Way capsules is maintaining my supply that Motherlove's started.<br /><br />In fact, now that I'm back to work, after my last pump in the morning, it will be 6 to 8 hours before I get to pump again at lunch at work, then another 4 to 5 hours after that before I get to pump again when I return home.  I then pump every 3 to 5 hours from the time I get home to the last time before work in the morning.  Even though I'm pumping less often than before (before it was after each feeding every 2.5 to 3 hours in a 24 hour span), I'm still pumping a very minimum of 5 oz total.  For those the times I have to go longer between pumps (more than 6 hours) I will pump up to a maximum of 11 to 12 oz total depending on how long I had to go between pumps."

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet."

They are of solid build, excellent rubber traction and dishwasher safe (although it's easier to quickly wash rather than take up valuable real estate in the dishwasher). We just picked up two 9 week old Newfoundlands (large breed) last week and can see how they have to navigate around the whole bunt cake style bowl, which should keep wolfing their food down to a minimum, as best as can be expected. This is quite important to us as one of our last beloved Newfies died from bloating a year and a half ago (the other who had been his shadow was never the same afterwards and died of kidney and other complications several months later). We had looked at some of the other bowls that had the large nubs protruding up from the bottom, and while the design looked good for dogs with slim snouts, I feel a big faced Newfie would have a frustrating time of it getting in there.

It does a good job conditioning.  My hair is soft and tangle free.  Using the conditioner and the shampoo has not made any difference in the volume of my hair.  That might be because I have thin fine long hair.  Just the weight of my hair could be keeping the volumizing from being effective.  My one big complaint is the size of the print on the container.  The smallest print is the word conditioner.  I wear glasses for reading and do not wear them in the shower (does anyone).  The print was so small that I could not tell which was conditioner and which was shampoo. I solved that by using a black marker to put a large S on the Shampoo and a large C on the conditioner.  It would have been nice if both words were in large print on the bottle.<br /><br />After I wrote this I had my hair cut much shorter.  I can tell a difference now.

522395,B001KUWFPC,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,Mad Max,111,130,1,1295827200,"We examined their claims, gave it a taste-test, & found multiple problems with Zevia...But here's a solution! (Read on)","First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!"

Add a fresh steamed vegetable and/or simple salad (or even, if you're really wiped out, high-quality canned or frozen vegetables -- try keeping a can of cut green beans, drained, in the fridge marinating with some fresh chopped onion and a wonderful vinaigrette as an instant salad for just such emergencies!), and you can have a meal on the table faster than you can get back home with takeout.

They were gross, nasty, disgusting, smelly, tasted horrible, and made me queasy just looking at them.

I rinsed it like a mad lady though I didn't get that overwhelmingly fishy odor even when I opened the bag like what was there with the spinach miracle noodles. Then I cooked the rice in the same broth that I cooked my vegetables and shrimp in. Oh dear Lord above, this was probably the best meal I've had since being on this diet! I didn't feel like I was suffering in the least, I didn't feel jipped, I felt as if I were eating an actual bisque.<br />Yes, the texture is different from normal rice. However I LOVE rice (all versions), I dream of rice, I love sushi, I love fried rice, you get the idea. I'm a foodie and one of my greatest craves is rice. This product made me feel like I were having actual rice. The texture I could get over. It wasn't sickeningly rubbery like the spinach miracle noodles. I think I'll have nightmares about those for the rest of my life!<br />I very highly recommend trying the miracle rice. I'd still rinse it more than what the directions say to just because that nasty spinach version haunts me. (And I like spinach!)<br />Next, I'm trying this product cooked in low-sodium chicken broth to use as a side for a nice yummy fillet of rockfish. Nothing goes better with fish than rice if you ask me. Hopefully this will work just as amazingly in this preparation as in the bisque.

I like Evian water taste (it feels 'fresh' to me) and often select it as the water I bring to work. I was not totally sure about the difference between different types of bottled water and wondered if it was just marketing.  Recently I came across a good explanation of different bottled water terms and I wanted to share the summary of the definitions here.<br /><br />Spring water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the Earth's surface. Spring water must be collected at the spring or through a borehole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. Evian and Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water.<br /><br />Artesian water is obtained from a well that taps a confined aquifer, an underground layer of rock or sand that contains water. Fiji Natural Artesian Water is one example of artesian water source.<br /><br />Distilled water is water that has been boiled and then recondensed from the steam that the boiling produces. The process of distillation kills microbes and removes minerals, however it tends to give it a flat taste. Glaceau Smartwater is distilled water.<br /><br />Mineral water is ground water that naturally contains a minimum of 250 parts per million of dissolved solids. ""Naturally"" means that the mineral were not added later,  it means all minerals must be present in the water when it emerges at the source. Calistoga is one example of mineral water.<br /><br />P.W.S. stands for Public water source (also often called municipal water supply or tap water). Aquafina is an example of water that came from a public supply.<br /><br />Purified water from any source that has been treated to remove chemicals and pathogens according to standards set by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia.  It must contain no more than 10 parts per million of dissolved solids. Distillation, de-ionization, and reverse osmosis are all purification methods. Aquafina and Dasani are examples of purified water.<br /><br />Sparkling water contains carbon dioxide at an amount equal to what it contained when it emerged from its source. Note that carbon dioxide lost during the treatment process may be added back. Perrier is an example of sparkling water.<br /><br />The terms ""glacier water"" and ""mountain water"" have no standard definition and thus it is not known exactly what is the original source of the water for the waters that use these terms to describe their product.<br /><br />Ali Julia review"

I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.

But it is still cafeteria food). On weekends the Children's side cafeteria closes down so you have to go over to the main hospital's cafeteria for dinner. Grabbed a turkey sandwich and was looking for some chips or something crunchy, and I saw these. I'm a big coconut fan so I figured I couldn't go wrong, and it's healthier than potato chips so I'm game. I made the mistake of trying a bite of them before I had my sandwich, I didn't want to put the bag down! Holy smokes, seriously the best 'chip substitute' I've ever had, and if they weren't so expensive I'd switch over from potato chips completely!! Perfect combination of salty/sweet, loads of coconut flavor (I've had some where it's really subtle and mild, this definitely is not), great size strips (like someone said, looks like they put it through a strip paper shredder just a bit wider), perfect crunchiness. Anyways, definitely a rare treat because of the expense, but so worth every penny! I may have to grab another bag for the road home though before we get discharged this afternoon. ; )"

Last time he got to pick out a matcha, we ended up with Cola, so this time I thought an alcoholic drink matcha was in order. More sophisticated? Well - more adult anyways ;)<br /><br />He is loving the flavoured matcha as much (if not more!) than I do! This one smelled sweet from the get go - creamy and .. tangy? Smoky? Not smoky! I'm trying to describe what irish cream smells like - it doesn't have the smokiness of whisky - but it definitely is sweet and creamy! I knew it was going to be a real treat - just like the real thing!<br /><br /> What a neat flavour experience! I prepared the matcha straight and thick for the first bowl. In this state I tasted mostly matcha with an aftertaste of sweet cream that lingered after finishing the bowl. It was very creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />Next I tried it over ice with 18% cream and sugar. I thought my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head and be lost forever! This was mine and Mike's favourite way to enjoy it. It's sweet, but because you have control over the amount of sugar, it's not crazy sweet and cloying. You could probably enjoy cup after cup with the only buzz coming from the energy of all that matcha you're drinking!<br /><br />This one is so so good mixed with the Madagascar Vanilla matcha - it just adds a bit of something that takes the creamy flavour over the top. Come St. Patricks day, it would be an awesome drink to mix with mint matcha (Mint is on the way in the mail as we speak!) and hey - it's already green!

I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos."

Enjoy the video! :)<br /><br />My (written) review: ;)<br /><br />Basically, this is to help anyone introducing Prowl to your cats for the first time. Once your kitties get used to Prowl, you can mix it up to different consistencies. :)<br /><br />I received a sample in the mail from Prowl before purchasing my first box of Prowl. This sample turned out to be very helpful, as the sample was for making one portion of cat food. The sample was ""1 ounce"" or ""29 grams"" to be mixed with ""1/4 cup water."" All three of my cats -- my 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair, my two-year-old finicky eater Siamese, and my six-month-old golden tabby, loved it.<br /><br />Then I bought a two-pound box. The directions say to mix 1/4 cup warm water with 1/4 cup Prowl.  Imagine my surprise when I weighed 1/4 cup of Prowl with a food scale and discovered that it only weighs 23 grams and, when mixed with 1/4 cup of water, makes a very watery soup that my cats turned up their noses at in disgust. Thankfully, I had kept the empty sample packet as a reference.<br /><br />I measured 29 grams of Prowl on the food scale, the same amount that was in the Prowl sample packet. To that I added 1/4 cup water. This time, the consistency came out perfectly, and my cats loved it.<br /><br />The ""Happy Cat"" ratio is: 1/4 cup Prowl (Sample Packet Prowl) i.e. 29 grams of Prowl to 1/4 cup water, and one way is with a food scale. Or you can mix your Prowl up a bit thicker and that will work just fine, too.  What my cats taught me is there is quite a difference in Sample Packet Prowl (29 grams) and the 1/4 cup ""Directions On The Box"" (23 grams).<br /><br />NOTE: The video mentions food scales, but you can just add extra Prowl if you don't have a food scale. :)<br /><br />My cats find this food very tasty (as you can see for yourselves in the video!) Enjoy your healthier cat! My cats are reaping the benefits and I can't say enough about this food: less shedding, less allergies, and my cats' overall condition.<br /><br />However you get there, I hope you find the purrfect ""Happy Cat"" ratio for your cat on Prowl!<br /><br />~~<br /><br />>> There is no snooze button on a cat who wants breakfast. &lt;&lt;"

I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

She needed a food that did not contain grains and was high in protein. It also had to be good for cats with sensitive stomachs. I also had a cat with diabetes. She needed a no grain food. This food met the needs of both cats. They have both since passed away but I continue to use this food. My 7 month old cat loves it as well as my 2 ferals I take care of. Yes it is pricey but greatr for cats with health problems. Cats do not need wheat or gluten. They need protein. Cat food or dog food should have chicken or fish as the fist ingredient not chicken meal or some by product. Add some of this food to your existing food at first and slowly change them over.

At the subscribe price, I got each of these really large bottles for about the same price I paid for a very small bottle at wally world, and they only carry a few sugar free flavors..<br /><br />We're on Atkins, so we've really cut down on carbs, but we both like sweets, so these syrups let us still have sweets without the carbs..<br /><br />The Hazlenut is not my favorite flavor, but I've used it in MiM's (muffin in a minute) and it tasted a lot better than I expected.. I know a lot of people use this flavor in coffee, but I don't personally like it in coffee. If you do, it'd be great for that.<br /><br />The Classic Caramel is delicious.. I've used it in MiM's, Italian sodas, protein shakes and in coffee.. I've also mixed it with the chocolate sugar free syrup and the two together make another delicious taste treat.. The two combined make the best Italian soda ever! I've made chocolate MiM's with cream cheese frosting flavored with this flavor.. Love the taste.<br /><br />I read some other feedback concerning the Classic Caramel, stating it isn't very good and to be sure to purchase the tradition Caramel.. I've never tasted the traditional, but have to say, I think the Classic is delicious.. Taste's like a piece of caramel candy to me.<br /><br />The Chocolate is delicious. Works good in MiM's, italian soda's, coffee, cream cheese frostings, protein shakes, anything you want to add chocolate to without the carbs..<br /><br />The Raspberry tastes exactly like raspberry's.. It's great.. We use it on home made yogurt with raspberry's on top.. pour a little syrup over it, and it's a delicious, low carb treat..Also great in a low carb protein shake mixed with raspberry's and a little syrup, mix in a blender and it's like a shake.. Delicious! I also used it in MiM's, or as cream cheese frosting on a chocolate MiM...YUMMY...Mixed it with chocolate in an italian soda.. Delicious..<br /><br />The Irish Cream is delicious used in a MiM in both the muffin and mixed in softened cream cheese to frost it.. Also fantastic in Italian soda's.. Haven't tried it in a protein shake yet, but imagine it'll be great. Probably great in yogurt, too.. Very tasty!<br /><br />I'm not a huge vanilla fan, but have to say, the vanilla is really good! Can be used in all kinds of things calling for vanilla, but really good when mixed with the chocolate in an italian soda or mixed in softened cream cheese to frost a chocolate MiM...<br /><br />All in all, great variety of syrups.. The one I would change is the Hazlenut.. I've just never been a big Hazlenut fan, but I'm sure I'll find more uses for it eventually."

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"

I am not too impressed myself. Compared to the product description, ""basted chicken filet"", what we received just doesn't match up. I expected something chewier, textured, meatier, and tougher. What I found wasn't a ""filet"" which implies whole-cut, but a soft ""patty"" a pressed ground bits. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was veggie-based! I should have read the reviews first, though I thought I could rely on the official product description and the overall excellent reviews.<br /><br />These treats are described as ""ridged"" to help ""naturally clean dogs teeth and gums"", to promote healthy oral hygiene. But what I received in the package (which looks just like the package depicted) is a thin, flat, and very soft which couldn't help clean teeth, especially when they aren't very chewy. Which doesn't matter anyway, since my snooty dogs won't eat them.<br /><br />I suspect their reticence has to do with the strong garlic smell coming off the patties. I think it stinks, but that's never stopped dogs from eating things before! I even expected them to perhaps think I was giving them ""people food"" since our food is highly seasoned. They didn't buy it. It's likely not chicken-y enough for them.

With each bag you're getting 11.5 ounces of high quality goodness.<br /><br />What's in ""Love Crunch?"" Well it's mostly road oats and chunks of dark chocolate, but you also get dried strawberries, dried raspberries (hence the ""red berries""), dried coconut, some flaw seed and a bit of vanilla. It's all very tasty. Although I know granola isn't everyone's go-to snack food (It isn't even mine), thiis is a really tasty mix and I'm even snacking on it while I write this review. If you're looking to get your kids to eat something healthy or trying to ease out of processed sweets, you should definitely consider Love Crunch (although the name is kind of dippy).<br /><br />Each serving is 140 calories and contains 9% of your RDAs of fat. Unfortunately a serving is only 1/4th of a cup. That's a lot of fat and calories for such a small serving - which is why I knocked a star off. There's only 1 gram of saturated fat per serving at least. It's also cholestrol free and very low in sodium. So it might not be the be the best granola for you, but it's still healthier than a candy bar or a piece of cake.<br /><br />I was also happy to see that for every bag of Love Crunch purchases, Nature's Crossing donates a bag to a food shelf/food bank. That means in purchasing this, you're also giving a high quality organic product to those who are in need and/or otherwise couldn't afford the extra cost of going organic. This is a really nice thing to do and it definitely helps encourage me to want to purchase more. Think of it as a ""Buy 1, Someone Else Gets 1 Free.""<br /><br />All in all Love Crunch is one of the tastier granolas that I've tried. I've had better and I've had worse, but this is still a great little granola I can happily recommend even to people who normally pass up this type of snack."

A crossover design was used. Two groups of five subjects each, i.e., 10 subjects total without known diabetes, were recruited for the study. They were not aware of which pasta product was being served. Regarding taste as well as mouth feel, our results confirmed the Dreamfields company claim. All subjects agreed that they could not detect a difference between the Dreamfields product and the traditional pasta. Both were considered to be highly acceptable. When the first five subjects were studied using the same cooking method for both products, the Dreamfields pasta did not result in a smaller glucose rise. To our surprise the mean postmeal glucose curves were essentially identical. Therefore, we studied five different subjects. The result was the same; that is, the curves were essentially identical (Fig. 1). In 10 people without diabetes, the Dreamfields pasta product we purchased did not result in an improved glucose excursion when compared with a commercially available traditional pasta product as would have been expected based upon the company's claim. Because we did not test several different batches of Dreamfields pasta or other commercially available pasta products for comparison, it is possible that different results would be obtained in other studies."

I like that it's pure, dolphin safe tuna with no added ingredients, preservatives, colors or flavors. It comes in a ziplock top bag.

While the Caribou Coffee's K-Cup flavor is not nearly as wimpy as Green Mountain or Donut House, it lacks that nearly burnt flavor that often pervades Starbucks' darker roasts.

These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it. [...]Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website. [...] Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. [...]. In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected."

I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste.

I had read that Head and Shoulders works for pets, so I figured i'd give this one a try since we had it on hand. It did an amazing job! He smelled great for days, his fur was SO shiny, soft and sleek and his dandruff decreased dramatically after the first bath with it. He stopped scratching and itching too. It was pretty amazing. I will remember to use this again if we ever have any skin issue with him. He had been scratching and flaking with dandruff for about 4 days. The day we used it, he was still scratching and flaking everywhere right before the bath.

Chef Michael's bag doesn't say exactly what percentage of the food is protein, but it claims to have real beef as its #1 ingredient. The dog food includes potatoes and green bean garnishes (whatever that means - to me a garnish is for decoration) and 23 essential vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately, none of the ingredients are organic.<br />Overall, I'd buy this if I had a smaller dog I wanted to give good food to, but the cost is a downer if you are feeding a larger animal."

So I started looking online for something better.  I tried the missing figs from nutsonline.  I was not dissapointed from those.  They are delicious - very moist.  I would say that the four one-pound bags of nutsonline figs I have bought so far were 98% moist, compared to the sunmaid figs at HEB being 30% moist (a lot of inedible ones). The figs from nutsonline don't have preservatives, so you have to refrigerate them as soon as you get them - but I think that's better for me.<br /><br />Note: The turkish figs are highly touted at nutsonline, but I didn't like them.<br /><br />Note 2: Another reviewer here said these sunmaid figs were moist when ordered from Amazon.

I was reluctant to switch because of the price, but with Subscribe and Save it comes out to just over $7/jar, which isn't terrible.  I'm now so spoiled that I can't go back to cheaper brands.  It has a rich, complex taste that is special for any coffee, not just instant.  Plus it's so easy to make iced coffee or ""lattes"" by simply using milk instead of water.  I now prefer the iced ""lattes"" I make with Mount Hagen to the $4 ones at the coffee shop, so in the end I might actually save money.<br /><br />Cons:  The one teaspoon per cup suggestion is a joke.  I need at least two teaspoons to get that delicious rich taste and to actually wake up.  That means there's more like 30 servings per jar, not 60.  Also, I wish it came in bigger jars.  These jars are tiny and I think we go through one a week.

It is my guess that the first order was damaged by the shipping company and left in too hot an area here in Tucson, and not a reflection on the product or store. I conducted a test and left one of the packages in a hot cupboard. I'll know the result in a few weeks.<br />END<br /><br />The only issue I had was five out of the six packages had been squished enough during shipping that the pillpockets all crumbled or were flattened.  This is how I got the idea to stretch them out in the first place so its not at all a bad thing. I can't quite figure how they got so squished because there was no damage to the box and the packages are a big air bubble.  I'll try another order and see if I get the same results.<br /><br />Don't pass this by. This is the best price I've found on these.  The local Petco sells them for $14.

We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds.

We could either be spending 50 cents or more for each premade baby food container from Gerber, or you can use this!  So, to list off its pros and cons:<br /><br />1.  Really easy to use.  Put some water into the steam side, put whatever you want cooked in the basket, turn it on, come back ~10-15 minutes later, chop it up in the blender side (we add more water and oatmeal at that point too), and then serve!  Start to finish is about 20 minutes tops, and only about 5 of those minutes are you actually there doing anything (the rest it's steaming so you're free to do whatever while it works).  Cleanup is very easy, just wash it out, which also just takes minutes, tops.<br /><br />2.  Cheap to use.  Fruits and veggies are cheap to buy at the store, certainly cheaper than buying pre-made baby food.  You'd be amazed how many meals one sweet potato will provide for a baby, I know I was!  Plus, you can theoretically cook anything in it for your baby, although we have yet to expand past fruits and veggies.<br /><br />3.  Expensive to buy.  On the other hand, we got this as a gift, so that wasn't a factor for us.

In addition to regular dry food I also buy her snacks for the occasional extra purr and smile that I am a sucker for. Greenies are one of two snacks that I buy that she simply adores.  I actually went to a local department store here quite a while back and bought a bunch of those little expensive snack pouches all at once to see which she would go nuts over, and which she would sniff and walk away from.  Greenies was one that she practically inhaled, along with Whiskas Temptations that I have included a link for at the end of this review.  Whiskas are available all over the place quite easily here in New England.  However Greenies I have only found at the local Tractor Supply Co, (TS).  If you have been buying your Greenies here on Amazon for you have been unable to find them locally anywhere, try your local Tractor Supply if you have one close by.  The price here on Amazon for them per pouch is just about the same as I pay at my TS. However when you toss in the shipping, they are more expensive.  However they can still be considered a pretty good deal if you order enough of them at once for the shipping charge doesn't change all that much with a double or triple order.  You also of course have the convenience of shopping from the comfort of your home here on Amazon, as well as in most cases avoiding the sales tax.<br /><br />In conclusion, I highly recommend the Greenies for the kitty you love to spoil in your life. As well as the Whiskas Temptations as well. (The price per pouch is a little more for the Greenies, but they are also a little bigger as well). If my cat is any culinary expert to be admired, they seem to be delicious, as well as nutritional for your pet.  My cat seems a little more partial to the seafood and salmon flavors over the others, but she quickly gobbles down any flavor.  That could be due to the fact I feed her very little in the way of seafood of any kind, so she may consider it a special dining experience.  It's my opinion that your cat will love all the flavors of Greenies as well.  (This is the link to the Dairy flavored Whiskas.  Check out the other various flavors available).  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NVJFQ"">Whiskas Temptations Creamy Dairy Flavor Treats for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />PS:  I have noticed lately that the package of Greenies as changed its design.

It tastes phenomenal and is healthy at the same time. Aloe is great for digestion and can calm some serious problems. But you'll forget about that when you taste it. It's so light and healthy and crisp and natural and refreshing and perfect. No other drink lives up to those adjectives. The flavor is like a smooth white grape juice with some honey and aloe magic thrown in. I especially love it on a hot day. Yes, Aloe can be nasty by itself but with the right tweaks it's heavenly. I gave up soda decades ago, and this is the only thing I've ever wanted to drink like soda, for pleasure alone. It has some sweetness to it, but I disagree with a few others saying it's too sweet. I think it's spot on, and I'm sugar sensitive enough to not enjoy much candy or rich desserts. The aloe content is not chunky, but smooth. It comes from powdered aloe rather than actual aloe chunks in other drinks. But the benefits are still there. I would love to see this product be available everywhere as an alternative to sodas, especially if that means the price would become lower. I'm a foodie and consider this my greatest drink find of all time. Actually maybe it's better not to tell too many people. : ) Do a subscription to save, as you can cancel anytime. Cheers!"

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough.

Please read this.<br /><br />Recently, I bought the box of 24 of this product.  I thought it might be good food to have in case of emergency.  However, this is the first time I've bought something on Amazon that had universal praise, but I disagree with it.  I am wondering what kind of Italian food these people are used to?  Do they actually know how Italian sauce is supposed to taste?  Because this is not tasty!  Actually, I found it rather yucky, and three other members of my family confirmed the same result.<br /><br />I followed the directions & made this exactly as was stated on the box.  The sauce you end up with has an undefinable, very strong taste to it.  Looking at the ingredients on the side of the box, it just lists ""spices"" so I don't know what that bad taste is really coming from.<br /><br />Also, the Kraft brand spaghetti is not very good quality.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to snap it to make it fit in the pot.  Other than that, the spaghetti is tasteless, fat, limp and bland.  Thank goodness there is not very much of that spaghetti (it only serves 4 from the box).<br /><br />On top of not liking this product, I found that the actual components are overpriced.  You should just buy some excellent pasta, such as Barilla spaghetti that doesn't cost very much and makes alot more servings.  Add to that any jar of pre-made sauce.  In a side by side taste test, I bet the Barilla+jarred sauce would taste way better.<br /><br />For now, I'm going to use up the awful Kraft noodles as well as I can, and chuck the ""flavor"" packets into the garbage."

I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

For protein supplements, I find the best value at Costco when purchasing Cytosport whey protein that costs approximately 2.2 cents per gram of protein.  Yet, it gets boring eating from the same six pound bag for months.  So, I recently evaluated two vegetable-based protein supplements: Nutribiotic Rice Protein and Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, both with chocolate flavoring.  While the Rice protein has great economics, tastes fantastic and contains few carbs, this hemp protein fails in all three categories.<br /><br />When I initially tasted Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, the first thought that came into my mind was ""is this product really suitable for human consumption!?""  Olfactory memories from large-scale grass cutting arose.  Even with the rich dark chocolate, I can't consume this protein straight or even mixed with milk.  The pungent taste needs to be blunted with large amounts of cinnamon and Splenda and/or mixing with high protein cereals such as Kashi or Special K.<br /><br />Another undesirable aspect of this protein includes the large amount of carbohydrates:  2.1 grams for every gram of protein. The economics are underwhelming as well.  It costs about 10.8 cents per gram of protein versus 2.7 cents per gram for the Nutribiotic Rice protein or 2.2 cents per gram of protein for the Cytosport offering at Costco.<br /><br />Cons<br />Terrible taste<br />High carb content<br />Poor economics<br /><br /> Pros<br />Rich dark chocolate flavoring"

There's also nothing else that tastes like it. Coconut water is a slightly opaque water that seems to have a little weight to it (it's not the milk, which comes at a later stage in the coconut's life). The taste of coconut is very faint, and it's super smooth going down. There are few things on earth more thirst-quenching on a hot day.<br /><br />Since, for most of us, young coconuts are not readily available, coconut aficionados are happy there's ONE Coconut Water. Water is usually my preference for a portable drink---filtered water from your tap in a stainless bottle. But there are times when water isn't going to quite do the job. Coconut water is packed with electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorous), so it makes for quick hydration. Keep some in the fridge and on hot days like today slip a couple in your backpack on the way out the door. Coconut water is also very useful to have on hand in the winter--it's great for when your child is sick and won't eat or drink.<br /><br />There is no sugar, it's miles away from any ""sport drink"" out there, and my son thinks it's a huge treat. The packaging is the eco friendly tetra-pak which supposedly doesn't leach any harmful chemicals (I'm always a bit skeptical these days) and ONE participates in a carbon reduction program. Be sure they are super cold--I like to have them refrigerated a good 24 hours before drinking."

He set the bar pretty high when I was growing up for good quality Mexican food and peppers. When I was a teen, he found a Mexican brand of jalapeno's named Faro. They were great, but you had to buy the big restaurant size cans. The peppers were firm and had a crunch. Then they stopped importing them and for decades we didn't run across any good peppers. All the brands I've tried are soggy. At best, you may find 1/3-1/2 the can has some peppers with some firmness. The rest are soft and/or slimy. We have a family recipe of stuffed jalapenos, using pickled (canned). It requires the peppers to be firm enough to be sliced in half, stuffed with a cheese mixture; and them to support the contents when you pick it up and eat it. Most canned jalapenos turn to mush somewhere in this process; usually at the beginning.<br /><br />To note, I've tried La Costena, Herdez, La Preferida, Casa Fiesta, La Victoria and Ortega. I also tried Trappeys, which comes in a bottle. Their texture is fantastic, but it's not a traditional Mexican pickling. I did buy them for a while for this recipe and they did work great; then Giant Eagle stopped carrying them (I live in Ohio now). Then I was at a small Mexican grocer here and thought I'd pick up the hunt again so I could make the recipe. I grabbed some La Costena, because they're everywhere, and typically you can get a few firm ones in each can. I also grabbed a can of San Marcos, because I couldn't remember if I'd tried them.<br /><br />Let me tell you, these are as good or better than the Faro's my dad used to buy! Every one was firm and fresh, very crunchy for canned jalapenos. And the flavor is fantastic. Being from Mexico, they're canned with the traditional spices, as well as carrot pieces and some onion. My dad likes the carrots, I can't stand them; but they do add to the jalapeno flavor. Hint though. Don't buy them here. Shipping is more than the cost of the product! Just Google your city's name with the words Mexican Market. If I can find them in Akron, OH, you can probably find them in your town.<br /><br />I can't keep these in the house. I eat them with hot dogs, burgers, and sometimes I'll just smear some refried beans on a tortilla with some cheese and throw it in the micro for a minute, just so I can have a quick bean burrito to go along with my craving for these amazing peppers.<br /><br />For something different, try their Serrano peppers as well. Slight different flavor, and slightly hotter. Same texture. Enjoy!"

I always marinate in a couple of large glass bowls but I do think it might be better if I can find a large thick sturdy clear plastic bag for that. It certainly would take up less room in my fridge, and I think I could take it out often and shake it up more thoroughly with out any spilling in my fridge. Good stuff this. Making home made Jerky is not a cut and dried deal. It takes a lot of trial and error and, a lot of research. This is good stuff and seeems to be a very good blend of seasoning to cure ratio."

Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"

They come in four flavors.  Cranberry is not my favorite of those flavors, but I still really like it, just not as much as blueberry and strawberry.  Though cranberries are pretty tart, the cranberry bar is not noticeably tarter than the others.  It does seem less sweet to me than the blueberry and strawberry ones, but the carbs and sugars are the same so it may be my imagination.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the ""glue"" that holds all the other ingredients together.  The third fruit in the cranberry flavor is dried cranberry.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is ""good"" fat.  The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better."

504783,B000H241DS,A3H3SG8XIXVKXZ,Science Aardvark,3,3,3,1340841600,Less than the sum of its parts,"This is a basic kit that may be of use to a beginner living in the sushi wilderness--away from large cities with Asian stores or even supermarkets that regularly carry Asian cooking ingredients. But if you have access to such locally, this kit is a waste of money. The most functional part of the kit is the ""sushi mat"", which is a collection of bamboo ""straws"" lined up and tied together to provide a rollable surface to make maki rolls. The rice spatula is a useful device, but the two of these together should cost about $2, although some supermarkets charge up to $5-7 for the privilege. The rest of the items--mainly food ingredients--are low quality and preservative laden. For half the price of the kit, one could pick up a tube of prepared wasabi (doesn't last as long as the powder but is usually more potent and easier to deal with) or a small can of powder (both about $3 each), a bottle of basic Kikkoman soy sauce (far higher quality even in the basic supermarket variety--will set you back between $2 and $4, depending on location and promotions). A pack of nori sheets will set you back another $5-6, unless you only shop at Whole Foods. The most expensive item might be the rice vinegar--pretty much any Japanese or pseudo-Japanese brand will do (Nakano [same as Mizkan], Mitsukan, and Marukan are the most common). With soy sauce and with vinegar, it's important to get the Japanese, not the Chinese varieties, as the flavors and concentrations will differ. The vinegar should always be unseasoned--then follow almost any internet recipe for seasoning sushi rice. Seasoned vinegars tend to be overflavored (salt, sugar) and are generally less desirable, although they will do in a pinch. Ideally, you should have a bottle of mirin (usually billed as ""rice wine"") on hand, but can either skip it entirely and add a touch more vinegar or use dry sherry in small quantities. The packaged pickled ginger (gari), including the one in the kit, is often an overly sour, cough-syrup-tasting mess. Unless you are going to make your own, you might as well skip it entirely. The enclosed rice is short grain, but not a high-quality sushi variety. You can just as well do with commercial short-grain rice (avoid long-grain or perfumed rice, such as basmati or jasmine). If you can get a hold of one of the Japanese brands (all grown in California!), so much the better.<br /><br />Aside from preparing the rice, you really don't need a cookbook and paying about $20 extra for it is really not a worthwhile exercise. The beauty of sushi is that you can pick and choose the ingredients that go in as ""stuffing"". If you don't like raw fish, there are plenty of raw vegetables and cooked ingredients that you can find. If raw fish is your bag, be careful where you buy it and how you store it--some regulations require sushi-grade fish to be deep-frozen once, then thawed properly before sale. If this is not done properly, the flesh will be off-color, watery and fibrous, as if after a freezer-burn. Supermarket grade raw salmon is not a good substitute either, as it is not handled with proper standards of cleanliness for sushi-grade fish. Avoid lake fish, as they often contain parasites (killed in proper cooking). When out of options, you can always use smoked salmon from a supermarket, other kinds of smoked fish or imitation crab flakes. The best option may be a lightly seared tuna steak, but these are very expensive. Fresh-caught saltwater fish is usually OK. Vegetables can be raw or cooked, but they should be cut into 1/4"" strips for use in maki rolls (or sliced diagonally for nigiri). Assembly is simple--for nigiri, just make an oblong rice ""ball"" from seasoned rice assemble all the ""toppings"" in reverse order on one hand, pick up the rice ball with the other, then join them together and lightly crimp the toppings on top of the rice. You can use a small dollop of wasabi as a binder, placing it on top of the rice ball before attaching the toppings. If maki assembly instructions don't come with your sushi mat, all you need to know is that the layer of rice should be about 1/4"" thick and the ""toppings"" or ""stuffing"" go across the mat, closer to the edge from which you start rolling. Also, leave about 1/2"" of nori uncovered, so that you can seal the edge once the maki is rolled up. It is quite common to line the sushi mat with two layers of plastic wrap (on both sides!) to simplify the process (and, in some cases, to satisfy sanitary regulations--not applicable at home). Other than the amount, there are really no limits on toppings, as long as they are not liquid.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the kit is serviceable, but with middling or low quality ingredients. It will do in a pinch, but is overpriced and somewhat overhyped. Don't expect to come up with sushi-bar-quality rolls from it, but if you're a novice, this makes for a good introduction."

I feed her half homemade food and half of the Halo. Halo in the morning , and homemade in the evening. She has a beautiful coat , shining eyes and is full of energy! Highly reccomended."
